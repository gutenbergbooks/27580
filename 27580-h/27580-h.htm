<h2 class="gap3">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The existing Lives of Raleigh are very numerous.
To this day the most interesting of these, as a literary
production, is that published in 1736 by William Oldys,
afterwards Norroy King at Arms. This book was a
marvel of research, as well as of biographical skill, at
the time of its appearance, but can no longer compete
with later lives as an authority. By a curious chance,
two writers who were each ignorant of the other simultaneously
collected information regarding Raleigh, and
produced two laborious and copious Lives of him, at
the same moment, in 1868. Each of these collections,
respectively by Mr. Edward Edwards, whose death is
announced as these words are leaving the printers, and
by the late Mr. James Augustus St. John, added very
largely to our knowledge of Raleigh; but, of course,
each of these writers was precluded from using the discoveries
of the other. The present Life is the first in
which the fresh matter brought forward by Mr. Edwards
and by Mr. St. John has been collated; Mr. Edwards,
moreover, deserved well of all Raleigh students by
editing for the first time, in 1868, the correspondence
of Raleigh. I hope that I do not seem to disparage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Mr. Edwards's book when I say that in his arrangement
and conjectural dating of undated documents I am very
frequently in disaccord with him. The present Life
contains various small data which are now for the first
time published, and more than one fact of considerable
importance which I owe to the courtesy of Mr. John
Cordy Jeaffreson. I have, moreover, taken advantage
up to date of the <i>Reports</i> of the Historical MSS. Commission,
and of the two volumes of <i>Lismore Papers</i> this
year published. In his prospectus to the latter Dr.
Grosart promises us still more about Raleigh in later
issues. My dates are new style.</p>

<p>The present sketch of Raleigh's life is the first
attempt which has been made to portray his personal
career disengaged from the general history of his time.
To keep so full a life within bounds it has been necessary
to pass rapidly over events of signal importance in which
he took but a secondary part. I may point as an example
to the defeat of the Spanish Armada, a chapter
in English history which has usually occupied a large
space in the chronicle of Raleigh and his times. Mrs.
Creighton's excellent little volume on the latter and
wider theme may be recommended to those who wish
to see Raleigh painted not in a full-length portrait, but
in an historical composition of the reigns of Elizabeth
and James I. I have to thank Dr. Brushfield for the
use of his valuable Raleigh bibliography, now in the
press, and for other kind help.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<h3>YOUTH.</h3>


<p>Walter Raleigh was born, so Camden and an anonymous
astrologer combine to assure us, in 1552. The
place was Hayes Barton, a farmstead in the parish of
East Budleigh, in Devonshire, then belonging to his
father; it passed out of the family, and in 1584 Sir
Walter attempted to buy it back. 'For the natural
disposition I have to the place, being born in that house,
I had rather seat myself there than anywhere else,' he
wrote to a Mr. Richard Duke, the then possessor, who
refused to sell it. Genealogists, from himself downwards,
have found a rich treasure in Raleigh's family
tree, which winds its branches into those of some of
the best Devonshire houses, the Gilberts, the Carews,
the Champernownes. His father, the elder Walter
Raleigh, in his third marriage became the second
husband of Katherine Gilbert, daughter of Sir Philip
Champernoun of Modbury. By Otto Gilbert, her first
husband, she had been the mother of two boys destined
to be bold navigators and colonists, Humphrey and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Adrian Gilbert. It, is certainly the influence of his half-brother
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, of Compton, which is
most strongly marked upon the character of young
Raleigh; while Adrian was one of his own earliest
converts to Virginian enterprise.</p>

<p>The earliest notice of Sir Walter Raleigh known to
exist was found and communicated to the <i>Transactions
of the Devonshire Association</i> by Dr. Brushfield in
1883. It is in a deed preserved in Sidmouth Church,
by which tithes of fish are leased by the manor of
Sidmouth to 'Walter Rawlegh the elder, Carow Ralegh,
and Walter Ralegh the younger,' on September 10, 1560.
In 1578 the same persons passed over their interest in
the fish-titles in another deed, which contains their
signatures. It is amusing to find that the family had
not decided how to spell its name. The father writes
'Ralegh,' his elder son Carew writes 'Caro Rawlyh,'
while the subject of this memoir, in this his earliest
known signature, calls himself 'Rauleygh.'</p>

<p>His father was a Protestant when young Walter was
born, but his mother seems to have remained a Catholic.
In the persecution under Mary, she, as we learn from
Foxe, went into Exeter to visit the heretics in gaol, and
in particular to see Agnes Prest before her burning. Mrs.
Raleigh began to exhort her to repentance, but the
martyr turned the tables on her visitor, and urged the
gentlewoman to seek the blessed body of Christ in
heaven, not on earth, and this with so much sweet persuasiveness
that when Mrs. Raleigh 'came home to her
husband she declared to him that in her life she never
heard any woman, of such simplicity to see to, talk so
godly and so earnestly; insomuch, that if God were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
with her she could not speak such things&mdash;"I was not
able to answer her, I, who can read, and she cannot."'
It is easy to perceive that this anecdote would not have
been preserved if the incident had not heralded the
final secession of Raleigh's parents from the creed of
Philip II., and thus Agnes Prest was not without her
share in forging Raleigh's hatred of bigotry and of the
Spaniard. Very little else is known about Walter and
Katherine Raleigh. They lived at their manorial farm
of Hayes Barton, and they were buried side by side, as
their son tells us, 'in Exeter church.'</p>

<p>The university career of Raleigh is vague to us
in the highest degree. The only certain fact is that
he left Oxford in 1569. Anthony &agrave; Wood says that
he was three years there, and that he entered Oriel
College as a commoner in or about the year 1568.
Fuller speaks of him as resident at Christ Church also.
Perhaps he went to Christ Church first as a boy of fourteen,
in 1566, and removed to Oriel at sixteen. Sir
Philip Sidney, Hakluyt, and Camden were all of them
at Oxford during those years, and we may conjecture
that Raleigh's acquaintance with them began there.
Wood tells us that Raleigh, being 'strongly advanced
by academical learning at Oxford, under the care of an
excellent tutor, became the ornament of the juniors,
and a proficient in oratory and philosophy.' Bacon and
Aubrey preserved each an anecdote of Raleigh's university
career, neither of them worth repeating here.</p>

<p>The exact date at which he left Oxford is uncertain.
Camden, who was Raleigh's age, and at the university
at the same time, says authoritatively in his <i>Annales</i>,
that he was one of a hundred gentlemen volunteers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
taken to the help of the Protestant princes by Henry
Champernowne, who was Raleigh's first-cousin, the son
of his mother's elder brother. We learn from De Thou
that Champernowne's contingent arrived at the Huguenot
camp on October 5, 1569. This seems circumstantial
enough, but there exist statements of Raleigh's own
which tend to show that, if he was one of his cousin's
volunteers, he yet preceded him into France. In the
<i>History of the World</i> he speaks of personally remembering
the conduct of the Protestants, immediately after
the death of Cond&eacute;, at the battle of Jarnac (March 13,
1569). Still more positively Raleigh says, 'myself
was an eye-witness' of the retreat at Moncontour, on
October 3, two days before the arrival of Champernoun.
A provoking obscurity conceals Walter Raleigh from
us for the next six or seven years. When Hakluyt
printed his <i>Voyages</i> in 1589 he mentioned that he
himself was five years in France. In a previous dedication
he had reminded Raleigh that the latter had made
a longer stay in that country than himself. Raleigh
has therefore been conjectured to have fought in France
for six years, that is to say, until 1575.</p>

<p>During this long and important period we are almost
without a glimpse of him, nor is it anything but fancy
which has depicted him as shut up by Walsingham
at the English embassy in Paris on the fatal evening
of St. Bartholomew's. Another cousin of his, Gawen
Champernoun, became the son-in-law and follower of
the Huguenot chief, Montgomery, whose murder on
June 26, 1574, may very possibly have put a term
to Raleigh's adventures as a Protestant soldier in
France. The allusions to his early experiences are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
rare and slight in the <i>History of the World</i>, but one
curious passage has often been quoted. In illustration
of the way in which Alexander the Great harassed
Bessus, Raleigh mentions that, 'in the third civil war
of France,' he saw certain Catholics, who had retired
to mountain-caves in Languedoc, smoked out of their
retreat by the burning of bundles of straw at the cave's
mouth. There has lately been shown to be no probability
in the conjecture, made by several of his biographers,
that he was one of the English volunteers in the
Low Countries who fought in their shirts and drawers
at the battle of Rimenant in August 1578.</p>

<p>On April 15, 1576, the poet Gascoigne, who was
a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, of Raleigh's half-brother, issued his satire
in blank verse, entitled <i>The Steel Glass</i>, a little volume
which holds an important place in the development
of our poetical literature. To this satire a copy of
eighteen congratulatory verses was prefixed by 'Walter
Rawely of the middle Temple.' These lines are perfunctory
and are noticeable only for their heading 'of
the middle Temple.' Raleigh positively tells us that he
never studied law until he found himself a prisoner in
the Tower, and he was probably only a passing lodger
in some portion of the Middle Temple in 1576. On
October 7, 1577, Gascoigne died prematurely and deprived
us of a picturesque pen which might have gossiped
of Raleigh's early career.</p>

<p>I am happy, through the courtesy of Mr. J. Cordy
Jeaffreson, in being able for the first time to prove that
Walter Raleigh was admitted to the Court as early as
1577. So much has been suspected, from his language
to Leicester in a later letter from Ireland, but there has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
hitherto been no evidence of the fact. In examining
the Middlesex records, Mr. Jeaffreson has discovered
that on the night of December 16, 1577, a party of
merry roisterers broke the peace at Hornsey. Their
ringleaders were a certain Richard Paunsford and his
brother, who are described in the recognisances taken
next day before the magistrate Jasper Fisher as the
servants of 'Walter Rawley, of Islington, Esq.,' and two
days later as yeoman in the service of Walter Rawley,
Esq., 'of the Court (<i>de curia</i>).'</p>

<p>It is very important to find him thus early officially
described as of the Court. As Raleigh afterwards said,
the education of his youth was a training in the arts of
a gentleman and a soldier. But it extended further than
this&mdash;it embraced an extraordinary knowledge of the sea,
and in particular of naval warfare. It is tantalising that
we have but the slenderest evidence of the mode in which
this particular schooling was obtained. The western ocean
was, all through the youth of Raleigh, the most fascinating
and mysterious of the new fields which were
being thrown open to English enterprise. He was a
babe when Tonson came back with the first wonderful
legend of the hidden treasure-house of the Spaniard in
the West Indies. He was at Oxford when England
thrilled with the news of Hawkins' tragical third voyage.
He came back from France just in time to share the
general satisfaction at Drake's revenge for San Juan de
Ulloa. All through his early days the splendour and
perilous romance of the Spanish Indies hung before him,
inflaming his fancy, rousing his ambition. In his own
family, Sir Humphrey Gilbert represented a milder and
more generous class of adventurers than Drake and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Hawkins, a race more set on discovery and colonisation
than on mere brutal rapine, the race of which Raleigh
was ultimately to become the most illustrious example.
If we possessed minute accounts of the various expeditions
in which Gilbert took part, we should probably find
that his young half-brother was often his companion.
As early as 1584 Barlow addresses Raleigh as one
personally conversant with the islands of the Gulf of
Mexico, and there was a volume, never printed and
now lost, written about the same time, entitled <i>Sir
Walter Raleigh's Voyage to the West Indies</i>. This expedition,
no other allusion to which has survived, must
have taken place before he went to Ireland in 1580, and
may be conjecturally dated 1577.</p>

<p>The incidents of the next two years may be rapidly
noted; they are all of them involved in obscurity. It
is known that Raleigh crossed the Atlantic for a second
time on board one of the ships of Gilbert's ill-starred
expedition to the St. Lawrence in the winter of 1578.
In February of the next year<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he was again in London,
and was committed to the Fleet Prison for a 'fray' with
another courtier. In September 1579, he was involved
in Sir Philip Sidney's tennis-court quarrel with Lord
Oxford. In May of this same year he was stopped at
Plymouth when in the act of starting on a piratical
expedition against Spanish America. He had work to
do in opposing Spain nearer home, and he first comes
clearly before us in connection with the Catholic invasion
of Ireland in the close of 1579. It was on July 17,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
1579, that the Catholic expedition from Ferrol landed
at Dingle. Fearing to stay there, it passed four miles
westward to Smerwick Bay, and there built a fortress
called Fort del Ore, on a sandy isthmus, thinking in
case of need easily to slip away to the ocean. The
murder of an English officer, who was stabbed in his
bed while the guest of the brother of the Earl of Desmond,
was recommended by Sandars the legate as a
sweet sacrifice in the sight of God, and ruthlessly committed.
The result was what Sandars had foreseen; the
Geraldines, hopelessly compromised, threw up the fiction
of loyalty to Elizabeth. Sir Nicholas Malby defeated
the rebels in the Limerick woods in September, but
in return the Geraldines burned Youghal and drove the
Deputy within the walls of Cork, where he died of
chagrin. The temporary command fell on an old friend
of Raleigh's, Sir Warham Sentleger, who wrote in
December 1579 a letter of earnest appeal which broke
up the apathy of the English Government. Among
other steps hurriedly taken to uphold the Queen's power
in Ireland, young Walter Raleigh was sent where his
half-brother, Humphrey Gilbert, had so much distinguished
himself ten years before.</p>

<p>The biographer breathes more freely when he holds
at last the earliest letter which remains in the handwriting
of his hero. All else may be erroneous or conjectural,
but here at least, for a moment, he presses his
fingers upon the very pulse of the machine. On
February 22, 1580, Raleigh wrote from Cork to
Burghley, giving him an account of his voyage. It
appears that he wrote on the day of his arrival, and if
that be the case, he left London, and passed down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Thames, in command of a troop of one hundred foot
soldiers, on January 15, 1580. By the same computation,
they reached the Isle of Wight on the 21st, and stayed
there to be transferred into ships of Her Majesty's fleet,
not starting again until February 5. On his reaching
Cork, Raleigh found that his men and he were only to be
paid from the day of their arrival in Ireland, and he
wrote off at once to Burghley to secure, if possible, the
arrears. His arrival was a welcome reinforcement to
Sentleger, who was holding Cork in the greatest peril,
with only forty Englishmen. It must be recollected that
this force under Raleigh was but a fragment of what
English squadrons were busily bringing through this
month of January into every port of Ireland. Elizabeth
had, at last, awakened in earnest to her danger.</p>

<p>Raleigh, in all probability, took no part in the
marchings and skirmishings of the English armies until
the summer. His 'reckoning,' or duty-pay, as a captain
in the field, begins on July 13, 1580, and perhaps,
until that date, his services consisted in defending Cork
under Sentleger. In August he was joined with the
latter, who was now Provost-marshal of Munster, in a
commission to try Sir James, the younger brother of
the Earl of Desmond, who had been captured by the
Sheriff of Cork. No mercy could be expected by so
prominent a Geraldine; he was hanged, drawn and
quartered, and the fragments of his body were hung
in chains over the gates of Cork. Meanwhile, on
August 12, Lord Grey de Wilton arrived in Dublin
to relieve Pelham of sovereign command in Ireland.
Grey, though he learned to dislike Raleigh, was probably
more cognisant of his powers than Pelham, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
may never have heard of him. Grey had been the
patron of the poet Gascoigne, and one of the most prominent
men in the group with whom we have already
seen that Raleigh was identified in his early youth.</p>

<p>From the moment of Grey's arrival in Ireland, the
name of Raleigh ceased to be obscure. Sir William
Pelham retired on September 7, and Lord Grey, who had
brought the newly famous poet, Edmund Spenser, with
him as his secretary, marched into Munster. With his
exploits we have nothing to do, save to notice that it
must have been in the camp at Rakele, if not on the
battle-field of Glenmalure, that Raleigh began his
momentous friendship with Spenser, whose <i>Shepherd's
Calender</i> had inaugurated a new epoch in English
poetry just a month before Raleigh's departure for
Ireland. It is scarcely too fanciful to believe that this
tiny anonymous volume of delicious song may have
lightened the weariness of that winter voyage of 1580,
which was to prove so momentous in the career of
'the Shepherd of the Ocean.' Lodovick Bryskett, Fulke
Greville, Barnabee Googe, and Geoffrey Fenton were
minor songsters of the copious Elizabethan age who
were now in Munster as agents or soldiers, and we may
suppose that the tedious guerilla warfare, in the woods
had its hours of literary recreation for Raleigh.</p>

<p>The fortress on the peninsula of Dingle was now
occupied by a fresh body of Catholic invaders, mainly
Italians, and Smerwick Bay again attracted general
interest. Grey, as Deputy, and Ormond, as governor of
Munster, united their forces and marched towards this
extremity of Kerry; Raleigh, with his infantry, joined
them at Rakele; and we may take September 30, 1580,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
which is the date when his first 'reckoning' closes, as
that on which he took some fresh kind of service under
Lord Grey. Hooker, who was an eye-witness, supplies
us with some very interesting glimpses of Raleigh in
his <i>Supply of the Irish Chronicles</i>, a supplement to
Holinshed. We learn from him that when Lord Grey
broke into the camp at Rakele, Raleigh stayed behind,
having observed that the kerns had the habit of swooping
down upon any deserted encampment to rob and murder
the camp followers. This expectation was fulfilled; the
hungry Irish poured into Rakele as soon as the Deputy's
back was turned. Raleigh had the satisfaction of capturing
a large body of these poor creatures. One of them
carried a great bundle of withies, and Raleigh asked him
what they were for. 'To have hung up the English
churls with,' was the bold reply. 'Well,' said Raleigh,
'but now they shall serve for an Irish kern,' and commanded
him 'to be immediately tucked up in one of his
own neck-bands.' The rest were served in a similar way,
and then the young Englishman rode on after the army.</p>

<p>Towards the end of October they came in sight of
Smerwick Bay, and of the fort on the sandy isthmus in
which the Italians and Spaniards were lying in the
hope of slipping back to Spain. The Legate had no
sanguine aspirations left; every roof that could harbour
the Geraldines had been destroyed in the English
forays; Desmond was hiding, like a wild beast, in the
Wood. By all the principles of modern warfare, the time
had come for mercy and conciliation, and one man in
Ireland, Ormond, thought as much. But Lord Grey
was a soldier of the old disposition, an implacable enemy
to Popery, what we now call a 'Puritan' of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
fierce and frigid type. There is no evidence to show
that the gentle Englishmen who accompanied him, some
of the best and loveliest spirits of the age, shrank from
sharing his fanaticism. There was massacre to be gone
through, but neither Edmund Spenser, nor Fulke Greville,
nor Walter Raleigh dreamed of withdrawing his
sanction. The story has been told and retold. For
simple horror it is surpassed, in the Irish history of
the time, only by the earlier exploit which depopulated
the island of Rathlin. In the perfectly legitimate opening
of the siege of Fort del Ore, Raleigh held a very
prominent commission, and we see that his talents
were rapidly being recognised, from the fact that for the
first three days he was entrusted with the principal command.
It would appear that on the fourth day, when the
Italians waved their white flag and screamed 'Misericordia!
misericordia!' it was not Raleigh, but Zouch,
who was commanding in the trenches. The parley the
Catholics demanded was refused, and they were told
they need not hope for mercy. Next day, which was
November 9, 1580, the fort yielded helplessly. Raleigh
and Mackworth received Grey's orders to enter and
'fall straight to execution.'</p>

<p>It was thought proper to give Catholic Europe a warning
not to meddle with Catholic Ireland. In the words of
the official report immediately sent home to Walsingham,
as soon as the fort was yielded, 'all the Irish men and
women were hanged, and 600 and upwards of Italians,
Spaniards, Biscayans and others put to the sword. The
Colonel, Captain, Secretary, Campmaster, and others of
the best sort, saved to the number of 20 persons.' Of
these last, two had their arms and legs broken before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
being hanged on a gallows on the wall of the fort. The
bodies of the six hundred were stripped and laid out on
the sands&mdash;'as gallant goodly personages,' Lord Grey reported,
'as ever were beheld.' The Deputy took all the
responsibility and expected no blame; he received none.
In reply to his report, Elizabeth assured him a month
later that 'this late enterprise had been performed by
him greatly to her liking.' It is useless to expatiate on
a code of morals that seems to us positively Japanese.
To Lord Grey and the rest the rebellious kerns and their
Southern allies were enemies of God and the Queen,
beyond the scope of mercy in this world or the next, and
no more to be spared or paltered with than malignant
vermin. In his inexperience, Raleigh, to be soon
ripened by knowledge of life and man, agreed with this
view, but, happily for Ireland and England too, there
were others who declined to sink, as Mr. Froude says,
'to the level of the Catholic continental tyrannies.' At
Ormond's instigation the Queen sent over in April 1581
a general pardon.</p>

<p>Severe as Lord Grey was, he seemed too lenient
to Raleigh. In January 1581, the young captain left
Cork and made the perilous journey to Dublin to expostulate
with the Deputy, and to urge him to treat
with greater stringency various Munster chieftains who
were blowing the embers of the rebellion into fresh
flame. Among these malcontents the worst was a certain
David Barry, son of Lord Barry, himself a prisoner
in Dublin Castle. David Barry had placed the family
stronghold, Barry Court, at the disposal of the Geraldines.
Raleigh obtained permission to seize and hold
this property, and returned from Dublin to carry out his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
duty. On his way back, as he was approaching Barry's
country, with his men straggling behind him, the
Seneschal of Imokelly, the strongest and craftiest of
the remaining Geraldines, laid an ambush to seize him
at the ford of Corabby. Raleigh not only escaped
himself, but returned in the face of a force which was
to his as twenty to one, in order to rescue a comrade
whose horse had thrown him in the river. With a
quarter-staff in one hand and a pistol in the other,
he held the Seneschal and his kerns at bay, and brought
his little body of troops through the ambush without the
loss of one man. In the dreary monotony of the war,
this brilliant act of courage, of which Raleigh himself in
a letter gives a very modest account, touched the popular
heart, and did as much as anything to make him famous.</p>

<p>The existing documents which illustrate Raleigh's
life in Ireland during 1581, and they are somewhat
numerous, give the student a much higher notion of
his brilliant aptitude for business and of his active
courage than of his amiability. His vivacity and ingenuity
were sources of irritation to him, as the vigour
of an active man may vex him in wading across loose
sands. There was no stability and apparently no hope
or aim in the policy of the English leaders, and Raleigh
showed no mock-modesty in his criticism of that policy.
Ormond had been on friendly terms with him, but as
early as February 25 a quarrel was ready to break out.
Ormond wished to hold Barry Court, which was the
key to the important road between Cork and Youghal, as
his own; while Raleigh was no less clamorous in claiming
it. In the summer, not satisfied with complaining
of Ormond to Grey, he denounced Grey to Leicester.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
In the meantime he had succeeded in ousting Ormond,
who was recalled to England, and in getting himself
made, if not nominally, practically Governor of Munster.
He proceeded to Lismore, then the English capital
of the province, and made that town the centre of
those incessant sallies and forays which Hooker describes.
One of these skirmishes, closing in the defeat
of Lord Barry at Cleve, showed consummate military
ability, and deserves almost to rank as a battle.</p>

<p>In August, Raleigh's temporary governorship of
Munster ended. He was too young and too little
known a man permanently to hold such a post. Zouch
took his place at Lismore, and Raleigh, returning to
Cork, was made Governor of that city. It was at this
time, or possibly a little earlier in the year, that Raleigh
made his romantic attack upon Castle Bally-in-Harsh,
the seat of Lord Roche. On the very same evening
that Raleigh received a hint from head-quarters that
the capture of this strongly fortified place was desirable,
he set out with ninety men on the adventure. His
troop arrived at Harsh very early in the morning, but
not so early but that the townspeople, to the number
of five hundred, had collected to oppose his little force.
He soon put them to flight, and then, by a nimble
trick, contrived to enter the castle itself, to seize Lord
and Lady Roche at their breakfast-table, to slip out
with them and through the town unmolested, and to
regain Cork next day with the loss of only a single
man. The whole affair was a piece of military sleight
of hand, brilliantly designed, incomparably well carried
out. The summer and autumn were passed in scouring
the woods and ravines of Munster from Tipperary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Kilkenny. Miserable work he found it, and glad he
must have been when a summons from London put an
end to his military service in Ireland. In two years he
had won a great reputation. Elizabeth, it may well be,
desired to see him, and talk with him on what he called
'the business of this lost land.' In December 1581 he
returned to England.</p>

<p>One point more may be mentioned. In a letter
dated May 1, 1581, Raleigh offers to rebuild the ruined
fortress of Barry Court at his own expense. This shows
that he must by this time have come into a certain
amount of property, for his Irish pay as a captain was,
he says, so poor that but for honour he 'would disdain
it as much as to keep sheep.' This fact disposes of the
notion that Raleigh arrived at the Court of Elizabeth
in the guise of a handsome penniless adventurer. Perhaps
he had by this time inherited his share of the
paternal estates.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3>AT COURT.</h3>


<p>Raleigh had not completed his thirtieth year when he
became a recognised courtier. We have seen that he
had passed, four years before, within the precincts of the
Court, but we do not know whether the Queen had
noticed him or not. In the summer of 1581 he had
written thus to Leicester from Lismore:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I may not forget continually to put your Honour in
mind of my affection unto your Lordship, having to the
world both professed and protested the same. Your
Honour, having no use of such poor followers, hath utterly
forgotten me. Notwithstanding, if your Lordship shall
please to think me yours, as I am, I will be found as ready,
and dare do as much in your service, as any man you may
command; and do neither so much despair of myself but
that I may be some way able to perform so much.</p></div>

<p>To Leicester, then, we may be sure, he went,&mdash;to find
him, and the whole Court with him, in the throes of
the Queen's latest and final matrimonial embroilment.
Raleigh had a few weeks in which to admire the empty
and hideous suitor whom France had sent over to claim
Elizabeth's hand, and during this critical time it is
possible that he enjoyed his personal introduction to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Queen. Walter Raleigh in the prime of his strength
and beauty formed a curious contrast to poor Alen&ccedil;on,
and the difference was one which Elizabeth would not
fail to recognise. On February 1, 1582, he was paid
the sum of 200<i>l.</i> for his Irish services, and a week later
he set out under Leicester, in company with Sir Philip
Sidney, among the throng that conducted the French
prince to the Netherlands.</p>

<p>When Elizabeth's 'poor frog,' as she called Alen&ccedil;on,
had been duly led through the gorgeous pageant prepared
in his honour at Antwerp, on February 17, the
English lords and their train, glad to be free of their
burden, passed to Flushing, and hastened home with
as little ceremony as might be. Raleigh alone remained
behind, to carry some special message of compliment
from the Queen to the Prince of Orange. It is Raleigh
himself, in his <i>Invention of Shipping</i>, who gives us this
interesting information, and he goes on to say that when
the Prince of Orange 'delivered me his letters to her
Majesty, he prayed me to say to the Queen from him,
<i>Sub umbra alarum tuarum protegimur</i>: for certainly,
said he, they had withered in the bud, and sunk in the
beginning of their navigation, had not her Majesty
assisted them.' It would have been natural to entrust
to Leicester such confidential utterances as these were
a reply to. But Elizabeth was passing through a
paroxysm of rage with Leicester at the moment. She
ventured to call him 'traitor' and to accuse him of
conspiring with the Prince of Orange. Notwithstanding
this, his influence was still paramount with her, and it
was characteristic of her shrewd petulance to confide in
Leicester's <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, although not in Leicester himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Towards the end of March, Raleigh settled at the
English Court.</p>

<p>On April 1, 1582, Elizabeth issued from Greenwich a
strange and self-contradictory warrant with regard to
service in Ireland, and the band of infantry hitherto commanded
in that country by a certain Captain Annesley,
now deceased. The words must be quoted verbatim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For that our pleasure is to have our servant Walter
Rawley [this was the way in which the name was pronounced
during Raleigh's lifetime] trained some time longer
in that our realm [Ireland] for his better experience in
martial affairs, and for the especial care which We have to
do him good, in respect of his kindred that have served Us,
some of them (as you know) near about Our person [probably
Mrs. Catherine Ashley, who was Raleigh's aunt];
these are to require you that the leading of the said band
may be committed to the said Rawley; and for that he is,
for some considerations, by Us excused to stay here. Our
pleasure is that the said band be, in the meantime, till he
repair into that Our realm, delivered to some such as he
shall depute to be his lieutenant there.</p></div>

<p>He is to be captain in Ireland, but not just yet, not
till a too tender Queen can spare him. We find that
he was paid his 'reckoning' for six months after the
issue of this warrant, but there is no evidence that he
was spared at any time during 1582 to relieve his Irish
deputy. He was now, in fact, installed as first favourite
in the still susceptible heart of the Virgin Star of the
North.</p>

<p>This, then, is a favourable opportunity for pausing
to consider what manner of man it was who had so suddenly
passed into the intimate favour of the Queen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Naunton has described Raleigh with the precision of one
who is superior to the weakness of depreciating the
exterior qualities of his enemy: 'having a good presence,
in a handsome and well-compacted person; a strong
natural wit, and a better judgment; with a bold and
plausible tongue, whereby he could set out his parts to
the best advantage.' His face had neither the ethereal
beauty of Sidney's nor the intellectual delicacy of
Spenser's; it was cast in a rougher mould than theirs.
The forehead, it is acknowledged, was too high for the
proportion of the features, and for this reason, perhaps,
is usually hidden in the portraits by a hat. We must
think of Raleigh at this time as a tall, somewhat bony
man, about six feet high, with dark hair and a high
colour, a facial expression of great brightness and alertness,
personable from the virile force of his figure, and
illustrating these attractions by a splendid taste in
dress. His clothes were at all times noticeably gorgeous;
and to the end of his life he was commonly
bedizened with precious stones to his very shoes. When
he was arrested in 1603 he was carrying 4,000<i>l.</i> in
jewels on his bosom, and when he was finally captured
on August 10, 1618, his pockets were found full of the
diamonds and jacinths which he had hastily removed
from various parts of his person. His letters display
his solicitous love of jewels, velvets, and embroidered
damasks. Mr. Jeaffreson has lately found among the
Middlesex MSS. that as early as April 26, 1584, a
gentleman named Hugh Pew stole at Westminster and
carried off Walter Raleigh's pearl hat-band and another
jewelled article of attire, valued together in money
of that time at 113<i>l.</i> The owner, with character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>istic
promptitude, shut the thief up in Newgate, and
made him disgorge. To complete our picture of the
vigorous and brilliant soldier-poet, we must add that
he spoke to the end of his life with that strong Devonshire
accent which was never displeasing to the ears of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Muse of History is surely now-a-days too disdainful
of all information that does not reach her signed
and countersigned. In biography, at least, it must be
a mistake to accept none but documentary evidence,
since tradition, if it does not give us truth of fact, gives
us what is often at least as valuable, truth of impression.
The later biographers of Raleigh have scorned even to
repeat those anecdotes that are the best known to the
public of all which cluster around his personality. It
is true that they rest on no earlier testimony than that
of Fuller, who, writing in the lifetime of men who
knew Raleigh, gives the following account of his introduction
to Elizabeth: 'Her Majesty, meeting with a
plashy place, made some scruple to go on; when
Raleigh (dressed in the gay and genteel habit of those
times) presently cast off and spread his new plush cloak
on the ground, whereon the queen trod gently over,
rewarding him afterwards with many suits for his so
free and seasonable tender of so fair a footcloth.' The
only point about this story which is incredible is that
this act was Raleigh's introduction to the Queen.
Regarded as a fantastic incident of their later attachment,
the anecdote is in the highest degree characteristic
of the readiness of the one and the romantic
sentiment of the other.</p>

<p>Not less entertaining is Fuller's other story, that at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the full tide of Raleigh's fortunes with the Queen, he
wrote on a pane of glass with his diamond ring:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fain would I climb, but that I fear to fall,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>whereupon Elizabeth replied,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If thy heart fail thee, then climb not at all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of these tales we can only assert that they reflect the
popular and doubtless faithful impression of Raleigh's
mother-wit and audacious alacrity.</p>

<p>If he did not go back to fight in Ireland, his experience
of Irish affairs was made use of by the Government.
He showed a considerable pliancy in giving his counsel.
In May 1581 he had denounced Ormond and even Grey
for not being severe enough, but in June 1582 he had
veered round to Burghley's opinion that it was time to
moderate English tyranny in Ireland. A paper written
partly by Burghley and partly by Raleigh, but entitled
<i>The Opinion of Mr. Rawley</i>, still exists among the Irish
Correspondence, and is dated October 25, 1582. This
document is in the highest degree conciliatory towards
the Irish chieftains, whom it recommends the Queen to
win over peacefully to her side, this policy 'offering a
very plausible show of thrift and commodity.' It is
interesting to find Raleigh so supple, and so familiar
already with the Queen's foibles. It was probably
earlier in the year, and about this same Irish business,
that Raleigh spoke to Elizabeth, on the occasion which
Naunton describes. 'Raleigh,' he says, 'had gotten
the Queen's ear at a trice; and she began to be taken
with his elocution, and loved to hear his reasons to her
demands; and the truth is, she took him for a kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of <i>oracle</i>, which nettled them all.' Lord Grey, who
was no diplomatist, had the want of caution to show
that he was annoyed at advice being asked from a young
man who was so lately his inferior. In answer to a
special recommendation of Raleigh from the Queen, Lord
Grey ventured to reply: 'For my own part I must be
plain&mdash;I neither like his carriage nor his company, and
therefore other than by direction and commandment,
and what his right requires, he is not to expect from
my hands.' Lord Grey did not understand the man he
was dealing with. The result was that in August
1582 he was abruptly deposed from his dignity as Lord
Deputy in Ireland. But we see that Raleigh could be
exceedingly antipathetic to any man who crossed his
path. That it was wilful arrogance, and not inability to
please, is proved by the fact that he seems to have contrived
to reconcile not Leicester only but even Hatton,
Elizabeth's dear 'Pecora Campi,' to his intrusion at
Court.</p>

<p>As far as we can perceive, Raleigh's success as a
courtier was unclouded from 1582 to 1586, and these
years are the most peaceful and uneventful in the
record of his career. He took a confidential place
by the Queen's side, but so unobtrusively that in these
earliest years, at least, his presence leaves no perceptible
mark on the political history of the country.
Great in so many fields, eminent as a soldier, as a
navigator, as a poet, as a courtier, there was a limit
even to Raleigh's versatility, and he was not a statesman.
It was political ambition which was the vulnerable
spot in this Achilles, and until he meddled
with statecraft, his position was practically unassailed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
It must not be overlooked, in this connection, that in
spite of Raleigh's influence with the Queen, he never
was admitted as a Privy Councillor, his advice being
asked in private, by Elizabeth or by her ministers,
and not across the table, where his arrogant manner
might have introduced discussions fruitless to the State.
In 1598, when he was at the zenith of his power, he
actually succeeded, as we shall see, in being proposed
for Privy Council, but the Queen did not permit him
to be sworn. Nothing would be more remarkable than
Elizabeth's infatuation for her favourites, if we were
not still more surprised at her skill in gauging their
capacities, and her firmness in defining their ambitions.</p>

<p>Already, in 1583, Walter Raleigh began to be the
recipient of the Queen's gifts. On April 10 of that
year he came into possession of two estates, Stolney
and Newland, which had passed to the Queen from All
Souls College, Oxford. A few days later, May 4,
he became enriched by obtaining letters patent for
the 'Farm of Wines,' thenceforward to be one of the
main sources of his wealth. According to this grant,
which extended to all places within the kingdom,
each vintner was obliged to pay twenty shillings a
year to Raleigh as a license duty on the sale of wines.
This was, in fact, a great relief to the wine trade, for
until this time the mayors of corporations had levied
this duty at their own judgment, and some of them
had made a licensing charge not less than six times
as heavy as the new duty. The grant, moreover, gave
Raleigh a part of all fines accruing to the Crown
under the provisions of the wines statute of Edward VI.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
From his 'Farm of Wines' Raleigh seems at one time
to have obtained something like 2,000<i>l.</i> a year. The
emoluments dwindled at last, just before Raleigh was
forced to resign his patent to James I., to 1,000<i>l.</i> a
year; but even this was an income equivalent to 6,000<i>l.</i>
of our money. The grant was to expire in 1619, and
would therefore, if he had died a natural death, have
outlived Raleigh himself. We must not forget that
the cost of collecting moneys, and the salaries to deputy
licensers, consumed a large part of these receipts.</p>

<p>While Raleigh was shaking down a fortune from
the green ivy-bushes that hung at the vintners' doors,
the western continent, at which he had already cast
wistful glances, remained the treasure-house of Spain.
His unfortunate but indomitable half-brother, Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, recalled it to his memory. The
name of Gilbert deserves to be better remembered than
it is; and America, at least, will one day be constrained
to honour the memory of the man who was the first to
dream of colonising her shores. Until his time, the
ambition of Englishmen in the west had been confined
to an angry claim to contest the wealth and beauty of
the New World with the Spaniard. The fabulous mines
of Cusco, the plate-ships of Lima and Guayaquil, the
pearl-fisheries of Panama, these had been hitherto the
loadstar of English enterprise. The hope was that such
feats as those of Drake would bring about a time when,
as George Wither put it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">the spacious West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being still more with English blood possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proud Iberians shall not rule those seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To check our ships from sailing where they please.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Even Frobisher had not entertained the notion of
leaving Spain alone, and of planting in the northern
hemisphere colonies of English race. It was Sir Humphrey
Gilbert who first thought of a settlement in
North America, and the honour of priority is due to
him, although he failed.</p>

<p>His royal charter was dated June 1578, and covered
a space of six years with its privilege. We have
already seen that various enterprises undertaken by
Gilbert in consequence of it had failed in one way or
another. After the disaster of 1579 he desisted, and
lent three of his remaining vessels to the Government,
to serve on the coast of Ireland. As late as July 1582
the rent due to him on these vessels was unpaid, and
he wrote a dignified appeal to Walsingham for the
money in arrears. He was only forty-three, but his
troubles had made an old man of him, and he pleads his
white hairs, blanched in long service of her Majesty, as
a reason why the means of continuing to serve her
should not be withheld from him. Raleigh had warmly
recommended his brother before he was himself in
power, and he now used all his influence in his favour.
It is plain that Gilbert's application was promptly
attended to, for we find him presently in a position to
pursue the colonising enterprises which lay so near to
his heart. The Queen, however, could not be induced
to encourage him; she shrewdly remarked that Gilbert
'had no good luck at sea,' which was pathetically true.
However, Gilbert's six years' charter was about to
expire, and his hopes were all bound up in making one
more effort. He pleaded, and Raleigh supported him,
until Elizabeth finally gave way, merely refusing to allow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Raleigh himself to take part in any such 'dangerous
sea-fights' as the crossing of the Atlantic might entail.</p>

<p>On June 11, 1583, Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed
from Plymouth with a little fleet of five vessels, bound
for North America. According to all authorities,
Raleigh had expended a considerable sum in the outfit;
according to one writer, Hayes (in Hakluyt), he was
owner of the entire expedition. He spent, we know,
2,000<i>l.</i> in building and fitting out one vessel, which he
named after himself, the 'Ark Raleigh.'</p>

<p>Sir Humphrey Gilbert was not born under a fortunate
star. Two days after starting, a contagious fever
broke out on board the 'Ark Raleigh,' and in a tumult
of panic, without explaining her desertion to the admiral,
she hastened back in great distress to Plymouth.
The rest of the fleet crossed the Atlantic successfully,
and Newfoundland was taken in the Queen's name.
One ship out of the remaining four had meanwhile been
sent back to England with a sick crew. Late in
September 1583 a second sailed into Plymouth with the
news that the other two had sunk in an Atlantic storm
on the 8th or 9th of that month. The last thing
known of the gallant admiral before his ship went down
was that 'sitting abaft with a book in his hand,' he had
called out 'Be of good heart, my friends! We are as
near to heaven by sea as by land.'</p>

<p>At the death of Gilbert, his schemes as a colonising
navigator passed, as by inheritance, to Raleigh. That
he had no intention of letting them drop is shown by
the fact that he was careful not to allow Gilbert's original
charter to expire. In June 1584 other hands might
have seized his brother's relinquished enterprise, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
therefore it was, on March 25, that Raleigh moved the
Queen to renew the charter in his own name. In
company with a younger half-brother, Adrian Gilbert,
and with the experienced though unlucky navigator
John Davis as a third partner, Raleigh was now incorporated
as representing 'The College of the Fellowship for
the Discovery of the North West Passage.' In this he
was following the precedent of Gilbert, who had made
use of the Queen's favourite dream of a northern route to
China to cover his less attractive schemes of colonisation.
Raleigh, however, took care to secure himself a charter
which gave him the fullest possible power to 'inhabit
or retain, build or fortify, at the discretion of the said
W. Raleigh,' in any remote lands that he might find
hitherto unoccupied by any Christian power. Armed
with this extensive grant, Raleigh began to make his
preparations.</p>

<p>It is needful here to pass rapidly over the chronicle
of the expeditions to America, since they form no part
of the personal history of Raleigh. On April 27 he
sent out his first fleet under Amidas and Barlow. They
sailed blindly for the western continent, but were
guided at last by 'a delicate sweet smell' far out in
ocean to the coast of Florida. They then sailed north,
and finally landed on the islands of Wokoken and
Roanoke, which, with the adjoining mainland, they
annexed in the name of her Majesty. In September
this first expedition returned, bringing Raleigh, as a
token of the wealth of the new lands, 'a string of pearls
as large as great peas.' In honour of 'the eternal
Maiden Queen,' the new country received the name of
Virginia, and Raleigh ordered his own arms to be cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
anew, with this legend, <i>Propria insignia Walteri Ralegh,
militis, Domini et Gubernatoris Virgini&aelig;</i>. No attempt
had been made on this occasion to colonise. It was
early in the following year that Raleigh sent out his
second Virginian expedition, under the brave Sir
Richard Grenville, to settle in the country. The experiment
was not completely successful at first, but
from August 17, 1585, which is the birthday of the
American people, to June 18, 1586, one hundred and
eight persons under the command of Ralph Lane, and
in the service of Raleigh, made Roanoke their habitation.
It is true that the colonists lost courage and
abandoned Virginia at the latter date, but an essay at
least had been made to justify the sanguine hopes of
Raleigh.</p>

<p>These expeditions to North America were very
costly, and by their very nature unremunerative for the
present. Raleigh, however, was by this time quite
wealthy enough to support the expense, and on the
second occasion accident befriended him. Sir Richard
Grenville, in the 'Tiger,' fell in with a Spanish plate-ship
on his return-voyage, and towed into Plymouth
Harbour a prize which was estimated at the value of
50,000<i>l.</i> But Raleigh was, indeed, at this time a
veritable Dana&euml;. As though enough gold had not yet
been showered upon him, the Queen presented to him,
on March 25, 1584, a grant of license to export woollen
broad-cloths, a privilege the excessive profits of which
soon attracted the critical notice of Burghley. Raleigh's
grant, however, was long left unassailed, and was renewed
year by year at least until May 1589. It would
seem that his income from the trade in undyed broad-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>cloth
was of a two-fold nature, a fixed duty on exportation
in general, and a charge on 'over-lengths,' that is
to say, on pieces which exceeded the maximum length
of twenty-four yards. When Burghley assailed this
whole system of taxation in 1591, he stated that Raleigh
had, in the first year only of his grant, received 3,950<i>l.</i>
from a privilege for which he paid to the State a rent of
only 700<i>l.</i> If this was correct, and no one could be in
a better position than Burghley to check the figures,
Raleigh's income from broad-cloth alone was something
like 18,000<i>l.</i> of Victorian money.</p>

<p>Such were the sources of an opulence which we must do
Raleigh the credit to say was expended not on debauchery
or display, but in the most enlightened efforts to extend
the field of English commercial enterprise beyond the
Atlantic. We need not suppose him to have been unselfish
beyond the fashion of his age. In his action there was,
no doubt, an element of personal ambition; he dreamed
of raising a State in the West before which his great
enemy, Spain, should sink into the shade, and he
fancied himself the gorgeous viceroy of such a kingdom.
His imagination, which had led him on so bravely, gulled
him sometimes when it came to details. His sailors
had seen the light of sunset on the cliffs of Roanoke,
and Raleigh took the yellow gleam for gold. He set
his faith too lightly on the fabulous ores of Chaunis
Temotam. But he was not the slave of these fancies, as
were the more vulgar adventurers of his age. More
than the promise of pearls and silver, it was the homely
products of the new country that attracted him, and
his captains were bidden to bring news to him of the
fish and fruit of Virginia, its salts and dyes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
textile grasses. Nor was it a goldsmith that he sent
out to the new colony as his scientific agent, but a
young mathematician of promise, the practical and
observant Thomas Hariot.</p>

<p>Some personal details of Raleigh's private life during
these two years may now be touched upon. He was in
close attendance upon the Queen at Greenwich and at
Windsor, when he was not in his own house in the still
rural village of Islington. In the summer of 1584,
probably in consequence of the new wealth his broad-cloth
patent had secured him, he enlarged his borders in
several ways. He leased of the Queen, Durham House,
close to the river, covering the site of the present
Adelphi Terrace. This was the vast fourteenth-century
palace of the Bishops of Durham, which had come into
possession of the Crown late in the reign of Henry VIII.
Elizabeth herself had occupied it during the lifetime of
her brother, and she had recovered it again after the
death of Mary. Retaining certain rooms, she now relinquished
it to her favourite, and in this stately mansion as
his town house Raleigh lived from 1584 to 1603. In
spite of his uncertain tenure, he spent very large sums
in repairing 'this rotten house,' as Lady Raleigh afterwards
called it.</p>

<p>Some time between December 14, 1584, and
February 24, 1585, Raleigh was knighted. On the
latter date we find him first styled Sir Walter, in an
order from Burghley to report on the force of the
Devonshire Stannaries. His activities were now concentrated
from several points upon the West of England,
and he became once more identified with the only race
that ever really loved him, the men of his native Devon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>shire.
In July he succeeded the Earl of Bedford as
Lord Warden of the Stannaries; in September he was
appointed Lieutenant of the County of Cornwall; in
November, Vice-Admiral of the two counties. He,
appointed Lord Beauchamp his deputy in Cornwall, and
his own eldest half-brother, Sir John Gilbert of Greenway,
his deputy in Devonshire. In the same year,
1585, he entered Parliament as one of the two county
members for Devonshire. As Warden of the Stannaries
he introduced reforms which greatly mitigated the
hardships of the miners.</p>

<p>It is pleasanter to think of Raleigh administering
rough justice from the granite judgment-seat on some
windy tor of Dartmoor, than to picture him squabbling
for rooms at Court with 'Pecora Campi,' or ogling a
captious royal beauty of some fifty summers, Raleigh's
work in the West has made little noise in history; but
it was as wholesome and capable as the most famous of
his exploits.</p>

<p>In March, 1586, Leicester found himself in disgrace
with Elizabeth, and so openly attributed it to Raleigh
that the Queen ordered Walsingham to deny that the
latter had ceased to plead for his former patron. Raleigh
himself sent Leicester a band of Devonshire miners to
serve in the Netherlands, and comforted him at the
same time by adding, 'The Queen is in very good terms
with you, and, thanks be to God, well pacified. You are
again her "Sweet Robin."' It seems that the strange
accusation had been made against Raleigh that he
desired to favour Spain. This was calculated to vex
him to the quick, and we find him protesting (March
29, 1586): 'I have consumed the best part of my fortune,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
hating the tyrannous prosperity of that State, and it
were now strange and monstrous that I should become
an enemy to my country and conscience.' Two months
later he was threatened with the loss of his post as
Vice-Admiral if he did not withdraw a fleet he had fitted
out to harass the Spaniards in the Newfoundland waters.
About the same time he strengthened his connection
with the Leicester faction by marrying his cousin,
Barbara Gamage, to Sir Philip Sidney's younger brother
Robert. This lady became the grandmother of Waller's
Sacharissa. The collapse of the Virginian colony was
an annoyance in the summer of this year, but it was
tempered to Raleigh by the success of another of his
enterprises, his fleet in the Azores. One of the prizes
brought home by this purely piratical expedition was a
Spanish colonial governor of much fame and dignity,
Don Pedro Sarmiento. Raleigh demanded a ransom
for this personage, and while it was being collected
he entertained his prisoner sumptuously in Durham
House.</p>

<p>On October 7, 1586, Raleigh's old friend Sir Philip
Sidney closed his chivalrous career on the battle-field at
Zutphen. Raleigh's solemn elegy on him is one of the
finest of the many poems which that sad event called
forth. It blends the passion of personal regret with the
dignity of public grief, as all great elegiacal poems
should. One stanza might be inscribed on a monument
to Sidney:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">England doth hold thy limbs, that bred the same;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Flanders thy valour, where it last was tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The camp thy sorrow, where thy body died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy friends thy want; the world thy virtues' fame.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></div></div>

<p>This elegy appeared with the rest in <i>Astrophel</i> in
1595; but it had already been printed, in 1593, in the
<i>Ph&oelig;nix Nest</i>, and as early as 1591 Sir John Harington
quotes it as Raleigh's.</p>

<p>It was not till the following spring that Raleigh
took possession of certain vast estates in Ireland. The
Queen had named him among the 'gentlemen-undertakers,'
between whom the escheated lands of the Earl
of Desmond were to be divided. He received about
forty-two thousand acres in the counties of Cork, Waterford,
and Tipperary, and he set about repeopling this
desolate region with his usual vigour of action. He
brought settlers over from the West of England, but
these men were not supported or even encouraged at
Dublin Castle. 'The doting Deputy,' as Raleigh calls
him, treated his Devonshire farmers with less consideration
than the Irish kerns, and although it is certain
that of all the 'undertakers' Raleigh was the one who,
after his lights, tried to do the best for his land, his experience
as an Irish colonist was on the whole dispiriting.
By far the richest part of his property was the 'haven
royal' of Youghal, with the thickly-wooded lands on
either side of the river Blackwater. He is scarcely to
be forgiven for what appears to have been the wanton
destruction of the Geraldine Friary of Youghal, built in
1268, which his men pulled down and burned while he
was mayor of the town in 1587. Raleigh's Irish residences
at this time were his manor-house in Youghal,
which still remains, and Lismore Castle, which he
rented, from 1587 onwards, of the official Archbishop
of Cashel, Meiler Magrath.</p>

<p>We have now reached the zenith of Raleigh's per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>sonal
success. His fame was to proceed far beyond
anything that he had yet gained or deserved, but his
mere worldly success was to reach no further, and even
from this moment sensibly to decline. Elizabeth had
showered wealth and influence upon him, although she
had refrained, at her most doting moments, from lifting
him up to the lowest step in the ladder of aristocratic
preferment. But although her favour towards Raleigh
had this singular limit, and although she kept him
rigidly outside the pale of politics, in other respects her
affection had been lavish in the extreme. Without
ceasing to hold Hatton and Leicester captive, she had
now for five years given Raleigh the chief place in her
heart. But, in May 1587, we suddenly find him in
danger of being dethroned in favour of a boy of twenty,
and it is the new Earl of Essex, with his petulant
beauty, who 'is, at cards, or one game or another, with
her, till the birds sing in the morning.' The remarkable
scene in which Essex dared to demand the sacrifice
of Raleigh as the price of his own devotion is best
described by the new favourite in his own words.
Raleigh had now been made Captain of the Guard, and
we have to imagine him standing at the door in his
uniform of orange-tawny, while the pert and pouting
boy is half declaiming, half whispering, in the ear of the
Queen, whose beating heart forgets to remind her that
she might be the mother of one of her lovers and the
grandmother of the other. Essex writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I told her that what she did was only to please that
knave Raleigh, for whose sake I saw she would both grieve
me and my love, and disgrace me in the eye of the world.
From thence she came to speak of Raleigh; and it seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
she could not well endure anything to be spoken against
him; and taking hold of my word 'disdain,' she said there
was 'no such cause why I should disdain him.' This speech
did trouble me so much that, as near as I could, I did describe
unto her what he had been, and what he was.... I
then did let her know, whether I had cause to disdain his
competition of love, or whether I could have comfort to give
myself over to the service of a mistress which was in awe
of such a man. I spake, with grief and choler, as much
against him as I could; and I think he, standing at the
door, might very well hear the worst that I spoke of himself.
In that end, I saw she was resolved to defend him,
and to cross me.</p></div>

<p>It was probably about this time, and owing to the
instigation of Essex, that Tarleton, the comedian, laid
himself open to banishment from Court for calling out,
while Raleigh was playing cards with Elizabeth, 'See
how the Knave commands the Queen!' Elizabeth supported
her old favourite, but there is no doubt that
these attacks made their impression on her irritable
temperament. Meanwhile Raleigh, engaged in a dozen
different enterprises, and eager to post hither and
thither over land and sea, was probably not ill disposed
to see his royal mistress diverted from a too-absorbing
attention to himself.</p>

<p>On May 8, 1587, Raleigh sent forth from Plymouth
his fourth Virginian expedition, under Captain John
White. It was found that the second colony, the
handful of men left behind by Sir Richard Grenville,
had perished. With 150 men, White landed at Hatorask,
and proposed to found a town of Raleigh in the
new country. Every species of disaster attended this
third colony, and in the midst of the excitement caused
the following year by the Spanish Armada, a fifth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
expedition, fitted out under Sir Richard Grenville, was
stopped by the Government at Bideford. Raleigh was
not easily daunted, however, and in the midst of the
preparations for the great struggle he contrived to
send out two pinnaces from Bideford, on April 22,
1588, for the succour of his unfortunate Virginians;
but these little vessels were ignominiously stripped
off Madeira by privateers from La Rochelle, and sent
helpless back to England. Raleigh had now spent
more than forty thousand pounds upon the barren
colony of Virginia, and, finding that no one at Court
supported his hopes in that direction, he began to
withdraw a little from a contest in which he was so
heavily handicapped. In the next chapter we shall
touch upon the modification of his American policy.
He had failed hitherto, and yet, in failing, he had
already secured for his own name the highest place
in the early history of Colonial America.</p>

<p>We now reach that famous incident in English
history over which every biographer of Raleigh is
tempted to linger, the ruin of Philip's Felicissima
Armada. Within the limits of the present life of Sir
Walter it is impossible to tell over again a story which
is among the most thrilling in the chronicles of the
world, but in which Raleigh's part was not a foremost
one. We possess no letter of 1588 in which he refers
to the fight.</p>

<p>On March 31, he had been one of the nine commissioners
who met to consider the best means of
resisting invasion. In the same body of men sat two
of Raleigh's captains, Grenville and Ralph Lane, as
well as his old opponent, Lord Grey. Three months
before this, Raleigh had reported to the Queen on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the state of the counties under his charge, and his
counsel on the subject had been taken. That he was
profoundly excited at the crisis in English affairs is
proved by the many allusions he makes to the Armada
in the <i>History of the World</i>. It is on the whole
surprising that he was not called to take a more
prominent part in the event.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is believed that he was in Ireland when the
storm actually broke, that he hastened into the West
of England, to raise levies of Cornish and Devonian
miners, and that he then proceeded to Portland, of
which, among his many offices, he was now governor,
in order that he might revise and complete the defences
of that fortress. Either by land or sea, according
to conflicting accounts, he then hurried back to
Plymouth, and joined the main body of the fleet on
July 23. There is a very early tradition that his
advice was asked by the Admiral, Howard of Effingham,
on the question whether it would be wise to try to
board the Spanish galleons. The Admiral thought
not, but was almost over-persuaded by younger men,
eager for distinction, when Raleigh came to his aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with counsel that tallied with the Admiral's judgment.
In the <i>History of the World</i> Raleigh remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To clap ships together without any consideration belongs
rather to a madman than to a man of war. By such an
ignorant bravery was Peter Strozzi lost at the Azores, when
he fought against the Marquis of Santa Cruz. In like sort
had Lord Charles Howard, Admiral of England, been lost
in the year 1588, if he had not been better advised than a
great many malignant fools were that found fault with his
demeanour. The Spaniards had an army aboard them, and
he had none. They had more ships than he had, and of
higher building and charging; so that, had he entangled
himself with those great and powerful vessels, he had
greatly endangered this kingdom of England.</p></div>

<p>Raleigh's impression of the whole comedy of the
Armada is summed up in an admirable sentence in
his <i>Report of the Fight in the Azores</i>, to which the
reader must here merely be referred. His ship was
one of those which pursued the lumbering Spanish
galleons furthest in their wild flight towards the Danish
waters. He was back in England, however, in time to
receive orders on August 28 to prepare a fleet for
Ireland. Whether that fleet ever started or no is
doubtful, and the latest incident of Raleigh's connection
with the Armada is that on September 5, 1588, he
and Sir Francis Drake received an equal number of
wealthy Spanish prisoners, whose ransoms were to be
the reward of Drake's and of Raleigh's achievements.
More important to the latter was the fact that his skill
in naval tactics, and his genius for rapid action, had
very favourably impressed the Lord Admiral, who henceforward
publicly treated him as a recognised authority
in these matters.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>IN DISGRACE.</h3>


<p>For one year after the defeat of the Spanish Armada,
Raleigh resisted with success, or overlooked with equanimity,
the determined attacks which Essex made upon
his position at Court. He was busy with great schemes
in all quarters of the kingdom, engaged in Devonshire,
in Ireland, in Virginia, in the north-western seas, and
to his virile activity the jealousy of Essex must have
seemed like the buzzing of a persistent gnat. The insect
could sting, however, and in the early part of December
1588, Raleigh's attention was forcibly concentrated on
his rival by the fact that 'my Lord of Essex' had sent
him a challenge. No duel was fought, and the Council
did its best to bury the incident 'in silence, that
it might not be known to her Majesty, lest it might injure
the Earl,' from which it will appear that Raleigh's
hold upon her favour was still assured.</p>

<p>A week later than this we get a glance for a moment
at one or two of the leash of privateering enterprises,
all of them a little under the rose, in which Sir Walter
Raleigh was in these years engaged. An English ship,
the 'Angel Gabriel,' complained of being captured and
sacked of her wines by Raleigh's men on the high seas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and he retorts by insinuating that she, 'as it is probable,
has served the King of Spain in his Armada,' and is
therefore fair game. So, too, with the four butts of sack
of one Artson, and the sugar and mace said to be taken
out of a Hamburg vessel, their capture by Raleigh's
factors is comfortably excused on the ground that these
acts were only reprisals against the villainous Spaniard.
It was well that these more or less commercial undertakings
should be successful, for it became more and
more plain to Raleigh that the most grandiose of all his
enterprises, his determined effort to colonise Virginia,
could but be a drain upon his fortune. After Captain
White's final disastrous voyage, Raleigh suspended his
efforts in this direction for a while. He leased his
patent in Virginia to a company of merchants, on
March 7, 1589, merely reserving to himself a nominal
privilege, namely the possession of one fifth of such
gold and silver ore as should be raised in the colony.
This was the end of the first act of Raleigh's American
adventures. It may not be needless to contradict here
a statement repeated in most rapid sketches of his life.
It is not true that at any time Raleigh himself set foot
in Virginia.</p>

<p>In the Portugal expedition of 1589 Raleigh does
not seem to have taken at all a prominent part. He
was absent, however, with Drake's fleet from April 18
to July 2, and he marched with the rest up to the walls
of Lisbon. This enterprise was an attempt on the part
of Elizabeth to place Antonio again on the throne of
Portugal, from which he had been ousted by Philip of
Spain in 1580. The aim of the expedition was not
reached, but a great deal of booty fell into the hands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the English, and Raleigh in particular received 4,000<i>l.</i>
His contingent, however, had been a little too zealous,
and he received a rather sharp reprimand for capturing
two barks from Cherbourg belonging to the friendly
power of France. It must be understood that Raleigh
at this time maintained at his own expense a small
personal fleet for commercial and privateering ends,
and that he lent or leased these vessels, with his own
services, to the government when additional naval contributions
were required. In the <i>Domestic Correspondence</i>
we meet with the names of the chief of these
vessels, 'The Revenge,' soon afterwards so famous, 'The
Crane,' and 'The Garland.' These ships were merchantmen
or men-of-war at will, and their exploits were
winked at or frowned upon at Court as circumstances
dictated. Sometimes the hawk's eye of Elizabeth would
sound the holds of these pirates with incredible acumen,
as on that occasion when it is recorded that 'a waistcoat
of carnation colour, curiously embroidered,' which was
being brought home to adorn the person of the adventurer,
was seized by order of the Queen to form a
stomacher for his royal mistress. It would be difficult
to say which of the illustrious pair was the more
solicitous of fine raiment. At other times the whole
prize had to be disgorged; as in the case of that
bark of Olonne, laden with barley, which Raleigh had to
restore to the Treasury on July 21, 1589, after he had
concluded a very lucrative sale of the same.</p>

<p>In August 1589 Sir Francis Allen wrote to Anthony
Bacon: 'My Lord of Essex hath chased Mr. Raleigh
from the Court, and hath confined him to Ireland.' It
is true that Raleigh himself, five months later, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
once more restored to favour, speaks of 'that nearness to
her Majesty which I still enjoy,' and directly contradicts
the rumour of his disgrace. This, however, is not in
accordance with the statement made by Spenser in his
poem of <i>Colin Clout's come home again</i>, in which he says
that all Raleigh's speech at this time was</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of great unkindness and of usage hard<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of Cynthia, the Lady of the Sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from her presence faultless him debarred,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and this may probably be considered as final evidence.
At all events, this exile from Court, whether it was
enforced or voluntary, brought about perhaps the most
pleasing and stimulating episode in the whole of
Raleigh's career, his association with the great poet
whose lines have just been quoted.</p>

<p>We have already seen that, eight years before this,
Spenser and Raleigh had met under Lord Grey in the
expedition that found its crisis at Smerwick. We have
no evidence of the point of intimacy which they reached
in 1582, nor of their further acquaintance before 1589.
It has been thought that Raleigh's picturesque and vivid
personality immediately and directly influenced Spenser's
imagination. Dean Church has noticed that to read
Hooker's account of 'Raleigh's adventures with the
Irish chieftains, his challenges and single combats, his
escapes at fords and woods, is like reading bits of the
<i>Faery Queen</i> in prose.' The two men, in many respects
the most remarkable Englishmen of imagination then
before the notice of their country, did not, however,
really come into mutual relation until the time we have
now reached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1586 Edmund Spenser had been rewarded for
his arduous services as Clerk of the Council of Munster
by the gift of a manor and ruined castle of the Desmonds,
Kilcolman, near the Galtee hills. This little peel-tower,
with its tiny rooms, overlooked a county that is desolate
enough now, but which then was finely wooded, and
watered by the river Awbeg, to which the poet gave the
softer name of Mulla. Here, in the midst of terrors
by night and day, at the edge of the dreadful Wood,
where 'outlaws fell affray the forest ranger,' Spenser
had been settled for three years, describing the adventures
of knights and ladies in a wild world of faery
that was but too like Munster, when the Shepherd of
the Ocean came over to Ireland to be his neighbour.
Raleigh settled himself in his own house at Youghal,
and found society in visiting his cousin, Sir George
Carew, at Lismore, and Spenser at Kilcolman. Of the
latter association we possess a most interesting record.
In 1591, reviewing the life of two years before, Spenser
says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One day I sat, (as was my trade),<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under the foot of Mole, that mountain hoar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeping my sheep among the cooly shade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the green alders, by the Mulla's shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There a strange shepherd chanced to find me out;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether allur&egrave;d with my pipe's delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pleasing sound yshrilled far about,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(the secret of the authorship of the <i>Shepherd's Calender</i>
having by this time oozed out in the praises of Webbe
in 1586 and of Puttenham in 1589,)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Or thither led by chance, I know not right,<span class='pagenum' style="text-indent:0em;"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, when I ask&egrave;d from what place he came<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And how he hight, himself he did ycleepe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The <i>Shepherd of the Oc&euml;an</i> by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And said he came far from the main-sea deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, sitting me beside in that same shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Provok&egrave;d me to play some pleasant fit,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(that is to say, to read the MS. of the <i>Faery Queen</i>,
now approaching completion,)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, when he heard the music which I made,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He found himself full greatly pleased at it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet &aelig;muling my pipe, he took in hond<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My pipe,&mdash;before that, &aelig;mul&egrave;d of many,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And played thereon (for well that skill he conned),<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Himself as skilful in that art as any.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the other poems thus read by Raleigh to
Spenser at Kilcolman was the 'lamentable lay' to which
reference had just been made&mdash;the piece in praise of
Elizabeth which bore the name of <i>Cynthia</i>. In
Spenser's pastoral, the speaker is persuaded by Thestylis
(Lodovick Bryskett) to explain what ditty that was
that the Shepherd of the Ocean sang, and he explains
very distinctly, but in terms which are scarcely critical,
that Raleigh's poem was written in love and praise,
but also in pathetic complaint, of Elizabeth, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">great Shepherdess, that Cynthia hight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Liege, his Lady, and his life's Regent.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is most valuable evidence of the existence in
1589 of a poem or series of poems by Sir Walter
Raleigh, set by Spenser on a level with the best work
of the age in verse. This poem was, until quite lately,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
supposed to have vanished entirely and beyond all hope
of recovery. Until now, no one seems to have been
aware that we hold in our hands a fragment of Raleigh's
<i>magnum opus</i> of 1589 quite considerable enough to give
us an idea of the extent and character of the rest.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1870 Archdeacon Hannah printed what he described
as a 'continuation of the lost poem, <i>Cynthia</i>,'
from fragments in Sir Walter's own hand among the
Hatfield MSS. Dr. Hannah, however, misled by the
character of the handwriting, by some vague allusions,
in one of the fragments, to a prison captivity, and most
of all, probably, by a difficulty in dates which we can
now for the first time explain, attributed these pieces to
1603-1618, that is to say to Raleigh's imprisonment
in the Tower. The second fragment, beginning 'My
body in the walls captived,' belongs, no doubt, to the
later date. It is in a totally distinct metre from the
rest and has nothing to do with <i>Cynthia</i>. The first
fragment bears the stamp of much earlier date, but
this also can be no part of Raleigh's epic. The long
passage then following, on the contrary, is, I think,
beyond question, a canto, almost complete, of the lost
epic of 1589. It is written in the four-line heroic
stanza adopted ten years later by Sir John Davies for
his <i>Nosce teipsum</i>, and most familiar to us all in Gray's
<i>Churchyard Elegy</i>. Moreover, it is headed 'the Twenty-first
and Last Book of <i>The Ocean to Cynthia</i>.' Another
note, in Raleigh's handwriting, styles the poem <i>The
Ocean's Love to Cynthia</i>, and this was probably the full
name of it. Spenser's name for Raleigh, the Shepherd, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
pastoral hero, of the Ocean, is therefore for the first
time explained. This twenty-first book suffers from
the fact that stanzas, but apparently not very many,
have dropped out, in four places. With these losses,
the canto still contains 130 stanzas, or 526 lines.
Supposing the average length of the twenty preceding
books to have been the same, <i>The Ocean's Love to
Cynthia</i> must have contained at least ten thousand
lines. Spenser, therefore, was not exaggerating, or
using the language of flattery towards a few elegies or
a group of sonnets, when he spoke of <i>Cynthia</i> as a
poem of great importance. As a matter of fact, no
poem of the like ambition had been written in England
for a century past, and if it had been published, it
would perhaps have taken a place only second to its
immediate contemporary, <i>The Faery Queen</i>.</p>

<p>At this very time, and in the midst of his poetical
holiday, Raleigh was actively engaged in defending the
rights of the merchants of Waterford and Wexford to
carry on their trade in pipe-staves for casks. Raleigh
himself encouraged and took part in this exportation,
having two ships regularly engaged between Waterford
and the Canaries. Traces of his peaceful work in
Munster still remain. Sir John Pope Hennessy says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The richly perfumed yellow wallflowers that he brought
to Ireland from the Azores, and the Affane cherry, are still
found where he first planted them by the Blackwater.
Some cedars he brought to Cork are to this day growing,
according to the local historian, Mr. J. G. MacCarthy, at
a place called Tivoli. The four venerable yew-trees, whose
branches have grown and intermingled into a sort of
summer-house thatch, are pointed out as having sheltered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Raleigh when he first smoked tobacco in his Youghal garden.
In that garden he also planted tobacco.... A few steps
further on, where the town-wall of the thirteenth century
bounds the garden of the Warden's house, is the famous spot
where the first Irish potato was planted by him. In that
garden he gave the tubers to the ancestor of the present
Lord Southwell, by whom they were spread throughout the
province of Munster.</p></div>

<p>These were boons to mankind which the zeal of
Raleigh's agents had brought back from across the
western seas, gifts of more account in the end than could
be contained in all the palaces of Manoa, and all the
emerald mines of Trinidad, if only this great man could
have followed his better instinct and believed it.</p>

<p>Raleigh's habitual difficulty in serving under other
men showed itself this autumn in his dispute with the
Irish Deputy, Sir William Fitzwilliam, and led, perhaps,
to his return early in the winter. We do not know
what circumstances led to his being taken back into
Elizabeth's favour again, but it was probably in November
that he returned to England, and took Spenser with
him. Of this interesting passage in his life we find
again an account in <i>Colin Clout's come home again</i>.
Spencer says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When thus our pipes we both had wearied well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... and each an end of singing made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He [Raleigh] gan to cast great liking to my lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great disliking to my luckless lot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and advised him to come to Court and be presented to
'Cynthia,'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whose grace was great and bounty most rewardful.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></div></div>

<p>He then devotes no less than ninety-five lines to a
description of the voyage, which was a very rough one,
and at last he is brought by Raleigh into the Queen's
presence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">The shepherd of the ocean ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto that goddess' grace me first enhanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to my oaten pipe inclined her ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she thenceforth therein gan take delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And it desired at timely hours to hear,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>finally commanding the publication of it. On December
1, 1589, the <i>Faery Queen</i> was registered, and a pension
of 50<i>l.</i> secured for the poet. The supplementary
letter and sonnets to Raleigh express Spenser's generous
recognition of the services his friend had performed for
him, and appeal to Raleigh, as 'the Summer's Nightingale,
thy sovereign goddess's most dear delight,' not
to delay in publishing his own great poem, the <i>Cynthia</i>.
The first of the eulogistic pieces prefixed by friends to
the <i>Faery Queen</i> was that noble and justly celebrated
sonnet signed W. R. which alone would justify Raleigh
in taking a place among the English poets.</p>

<p>Raleigh's position was once more secure in the sunlight.
He could hold Sir William Fitzwilliam informed,
on December 29, that 'I take myself far his better by
the honourable office I hold, as well as by that nearness
to her Majesty which still I enjoy, and never more.'
The next two years were a sort of breathing space in
Raleigh's career; he had reached the table-land of his
fortunes, and neither rose nor fell in favour. The
violent crisis of the Spanish Armada had marked
the close of an epoch at Court. In September
1588 Leicester died, in April 1590 Walsingham, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
September 1591 Sir Christopher Hatton, three men in
whose presence, however apt Raleigh might be to
vaunt his influence, he could never have felt absolutely
master. New men were coming on, but for the moment
the most violent and aggressive of his rivals, Essex,
was disposed to wave a flag of truce. Both Raleigh
and Essex saw one thing more clearly than the Queen
herself, namely, that the loyalty of the Puritans, whom
Elizabeth disliked, was the great safeguard of the
nation against Catholic encroachment, and they united
their forces in trying to protect the interests of men
like John Udall against the Queen's turbulent prejudices.
In March 1591 we find it absolutely recorded
that the Earl of Essex and Raleigh have joined 'as
instruments from the Puritans to the Queen upon any
particular occasion of relieving them.' With Essex,
some sort of genuine Protestant fervour seems to have
acted; Raleigh, according to all evidence, was a man
without religious interests, but far before his age in
tolerance for the opinions of others, and he was swayed,
no doubt, in this as in other cases, by his dislike of
persecution on the one hand, and his implacable enmity
to Spain on the other.</p>

<p>In May 1591, Raleigh was hurriedly sent down the
Channel in a pinnace to warn Lord Thomas Howard
that Spanish ships had been seen near the Scilly Islands.
There was a project for sending a fleet of twenty ships
to Spain, and Raleigh was to be second in command,
but the scheme was altered. In November 1591 he
first came before the public as an author with a tract
in which he celebrated the prowess of one of his best
friends and truest servants, Sir Richard Grenville, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
contest with the Spaniard which is one of the most
famous in English history. Raleigh's little volume
is entitled: <i>A Report of the Truth of the Fight about
the Iles of the A&ccedil;ores this last Sommer betwixt the
'Reuenge' and an Armada of the King of Spaine</i>. The
fight had taken place on the preceding 10th of September;
the odds against the 'Revenge' were so
excessive that Grenville was freely blamed for needless
foolhardiness, in facing 15,000 Spaniards with only 100
men. Raleigh wrote his <i>Report</i> to justify the memory
of his friend, and doubtless hastened its publication
that it might be received as evidence before Sir R.
Beville's commission, which was to meet a month later
to inquire into the circumstances of Grenville's death.
Posterity has taken Raleigh's view, and all Englishmen,
from Lord Bacon to Lord Tennyson, have united in
praising this fight as one 'memorable even beyond
credit, and to the height of some heroical fable.'</p>

<p>The <i>Report</i> of 1591 was anonymous, and it was
Hakluyt first who, in reprinting it in 1599, was permitted
to state that it was 'penned by the honourable
Sir Walter Ralegh, knight.' Long entirely neglected,
it has of late become the best known of all its author's
productions. It is written in a sane and manly style,
and marks the highest level reached by English narrative
prose as it existed before the waters were
troubled by the fashion of Euphues. Not issued with
Raleigh's name, it was yet no doubt at once recognised
as his work, and it cannot have been without influence
in determining the policy of the country with Spain.
The author's enmity to the Spaniard is inveterate, and
he is careful in an eloquent introduction to prove that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
he is not actuated by resentment on account of this one
act of cruel cowardice, but by a divine anger, justified
by the events of years, 'against the ambitious and
bloody pretences of the Spaniard, who, seeking to
devour all nations, shall be themselves devoured.' The
tract closes with a passionate appeal to the loyalty of the
English Catholics, who are warned by the sufferings of
Portugal that 'the obedience even of the Turk is easy
and a liberty, in respect of the slavery and tyranny of
Spain,' and who will never be so safe as when they are
trusting in the clemency of her Majesty. All this is in
the highest degree characteristic of Raleigh, whose
central idea in life was not prejudice against the
Catholic religion, for he was singularly broad in this
respect, but, in his own words, 'hatred of the tyrannous
prosperity of Spain.' This ran like a red strand
through his whole career from Smerwick to the block,
and this was at once the measure of his greatness and
the secret of his fall.</p>

<p>It was formerly supposed that Raleigh came into
possession of Sherborne, his favourite country residence,
in 1594, that is to say after the Throckmorton incident.
It is, however, in the highest degree improbable that
such an estate would be given to him after his fatal
offence, and in fact it is now certain that the lease was
extended to him much earlier, probably in October 1591.
There is a pleasant legend that Raleigh and one of his
half-brothers were riding up to town from Plymouth,
when Raleigh's horse stumbled and threw him within
the precincts of a beautiful Dorsetshire estate, then in
possession of the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury, and
that Raleigh, choosing to consider that he had thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
taken seisin of the soil, asked the Queen for Sherborne
Castle when he arrived at Court. It may have been on
this occasion that Elizabeth asked him when he would
cease to be a beggar, and received the reply, 'When your
Majesty ceases to be a benefactor!' His first lease
included a payment of 260<i>l.</i> a year to the Bishop of
Salisbury, who asserted a claim to the property. In
January 1592, after the payment of a quarter's rent,
Raleigh was confirmed in possession, and began to improve
and enjoy the property. It consisted of the
manor of Sherborne, with a large park, a castle which
had to be repaired, and several farms and hamlets,
together with a street in the borough of Sherborne
itself. It is a curious fact that Raleigh had to present
the Queen with a jewel worth 250<i>l.</i> to induce her 'to
make the Bishop,' that is to say, to appoint to the see of
Salisbury, now vacant, a man who would consent to the
alienation of such rich Church lands as the manors of
Sherborne and Yetminster. John Meeres, afterwards so
determined and exasperating an enemy of Raleigh's, was
now<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> appointed his bailiff, and Adrian Gilbert a sort of
general overseer of the works.</p>

<p>Raleigh had been but two months settled in possession
of Sherborne, with his ninety-nine years' lease
clearly made out, when he passed suddenly out of the
sunlight into the deepest shadow of approaching disfavour.
The year opened with promise of greater activity
and higher public honours than Raleigh had yet
displayed and enjoyed. An expedition was to be sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
to capture the rich fleet of plate-ships, known as the
Indian Carracks, and then to push on to storm the pearl
treasuries of Panama. For the first time, Elizabeth
had shown herself willing to trust her favourite in
person on the perilous western seas. Raleigh was to
command the fleet of fifteen ships, and under him was
to serve the morose hero of Cathay, the dreadful Sir
Martin Frobisher. Raleigh was not only to be admiral
of the expedition, but its chief adventurer also, and in
order to bear this expense he had collected his available
fortune from various quarters, stripping himself of all
immediate resources. To help him, the Queen had
bought The Ark Raleigh, his largest ship, for 5,000<i>l.</i>;
and in February 1592 he was ready to sail. When
the moment for parting came, however, the Queen found
it impossible to spare him, and Sir John Burrough was
appointed admiral.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to move with confidence
in this obscure part of our narrative. On March 10,
1592, we find Raleigh at Chatham, busy about the wages
of the sailors, and trying to persuade them to serve
under Frobisher, whose reputation for severity made him
very unpopular. He writes on that day to Sir Robert
Cecil, and uses these ambiguous expressions with regard
to a rumour of which we now hear for the first time:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I mean not to come away, as they say I will, for fear of
a marriage, and I know not what. If any such thing were,
I would have imparted it to yourself, before any man living;
and therefore, I pray, believe it not, and I beseech you to
suppress, what you can, any such malicious report. For I
protest before God, there is none, on the face of the earth,
that I would be fastened unto.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Raleigh was now in a desperate embarrassment.
There was that concealed in his private life which could
only be condoned by absence; he had seen before him
an unexpected chance of escape from England, and now
the Queen's tedious fondness had closed it again. The
desperate fault which he had committed was that he had
loved too well and not at all wisely a beautiful orphan,
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, a
maid of honour to the Queen. It is supposed that she
was two or three and twenty at the time. Whether
he seduced her, and married her after his imprisonment
in the Tower, or whether in the early months of 1592
there was a private marriage, has been doubted. The
biographers of Raleigh have preferred to believe the
latter, but it is to be feared that his fair fame in this
matter cannot be maintained unsullied. Among Sir
Walter Raleigh's children one daughter appears to have
been illegitimate, 'my poor daughter, to whom I have
given nothing, for his sake who will be cruel to himself
to preserve thee,' as he says to Lady Raleigh in 1603,
and it may be that it was the birth of this child which
brought down the vengeance of Queen Elizabeth upon
their heads.</p>

<p>His clandestine relations with Elizabeth Throckmorton
were not in themselves without excuse. To be
the favourite of Elizabeth, who had now herself attained
the sixtieth summer of her immortal charms, was
tantamount to a condemnation to celibacy. The vanity
of Belph&oelig;be would admit no rival among high or low,
and the least divergence from the devotion justly due to
her own imperial loveliness was a mortal sin. What is
less easy to forgive in Raleigh than that at the age of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
forty he should have rebelled at last against this tyranny,
is that he seems, in the crisis of his embarrassment, to
have abandoned the woman to whom he could write
long afterwards, 'I chose you and I loved you in my
happiest times.' After this brief dereliction, however,
he returned to his duty, and for the rest of his life was
eminently faithful to the wife whom he had taken under
such painful circumstances.</p>

<p>There is a lacuna in the evidence as to what
actually happened early in 1592; the late Mr. J. P.
Collier filled up this gap with a convenient letter, which
has found its way into the histories of Raleigh, but
the original of which has never been seen by other eyes
than the transcriber's. What is certain is that Raleigh
contrived to conceal the state of things from the Queen,
and to steal away to sea on the pretext that he was
merely accompanying Sir Martin Frobisher to the
mouth of the Channel. He says himself that on May
13, 1592, he was 'about forty leagues off the Cape
Finisterre.' It was reported that the Queen sent a ship
after him to insist on his return, but such a messenger
would have had little chance of finding him when once
he had reached the latitude of Portugal, and it is more
reasonable to suppose that after straying away as far as
he dared, he came back again of his own accord. On
June 8 he was still living unmolested in Durham
House, and dealing, as a person in authority, with
certain questions of international navigation. Three
weeks later the Queen seems to have discovered, what
everyone about her knew already, the nature of
Raleigh's relations with Elizabeth Throckmorton. On
July 28 Sir Edward Stafford wrote to Anthony Bacon:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
'If you have anything to do with Sir Walter Raleigh,
or any love to make to Mrs. Throckmorton, at the Tower
to-morrow you may speak with them.' It was four
years before Raleigh was admitted again to the presence
of his enraged Belph&oelig;be.</p>

<p>Needless prominence has been given to this imprisonment
of Raleigh's, which lasted something less than
two months. He was exceedingly restive under constraint,
however, and filled the air with the picturesque
clamour of his distress. His first idea was to soften
the Queen's heart by outrageous protestations of anxious
devotion to her person. The following passage from a
letter to Sir Robert Cecil is remarkable in many ways,
curious as an example of affected passion in a soldier of
forty for a maiden of sixty, curious as a piece of carefully
modulated Euphuistic prose in the fashion of the hour,
most curious as the language of a man from whom the
one woman that he really loved was divided by the damp
wall of a prison:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My heart was never broken till this day, that I hear the
Queen goes away so far off, whom I have followed so many
years with so great love and desire, in so many journeys,
and am now left behind her, in a dark prison all alone.
While she was yet nigher at hand, that I might hear of her
once in two or three days, my sorrows were the less; but
even now my heart is cast into the depth of all misery. I
that was wont to behold her riding like Alexander, hunting
like Diana, walking like Venus, the gentle wind blowing
her fair hair about her pure cheeks, like a nymph; sometime
sitting in the shade like a goddess; sometime singing
like an angel; sometime playing like Orpheus. Behold the
sorrow of this world! Once amiss, hath bereaved me of all.
O Glory, that only shineth in misfortune, what is become of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
thy assurance? All wounds have scars, but that of fantasy;
all affections their relenting, but that of womankind.
Who is the judge of friendship, but adversity? or when is
grace witnessed, but in offences? There were no divinity,
but by reason of compassion for revenges are brutish and
mortal. All those times past, the loves, the sights, the
sorrows, the desires, can they not weigh down one frail misfortune?
Cannot one drop of salt be hidden in so great
heaps of sweetness? I may then conclude, <i>Spes et fortuna,
valete</i>! She is gone in whom I trusted, and of me hath not
one thought of mercy, nor any respect of that that was. Do
with me now, therefore, what you list. I am more weary
of life than they are desirous I should perish.</p></div>

<p>He kept up this comedy of passion with wonderful
energy. One day, when the royal barge, passing down
to Gravesend, crossed below his window, he raved and
stormed, swearing that his enemies had brought the
Queen thither 'to break his gall in sunder with
Tantalus' torment.' Another time he protested that he
must disguise himself as a boatman, and just catch a
sight of the Queen, or else his heart would break. He
drew his dagger on his keeper, Sir George Carew, and
broke the knuckles of Sir Arthur Gorges, because he
said they were restraining him from the sight of his
Mistress. He proposed to Lord Howard of Effingham
at the close of a business letter, that he should be thrown
to feed the lions, 'to save labour,' as the Queen was
still so cruel. Sir Arthur Gorges was in despair; he
thought that Raleigh was going mad. 'He will shortly
grow,' he said, 'to be Orlando Furioso, if the bright
Angelica persevere against him a little longer.'</p>

<p>It was all a farce, of course, but underneath the
fantastic affectation there was a very real sentiment, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
of the intolerable tedium of captivity. Raleigh had
been living a life of exaggerated activity, never a month
at rest, now at sea, now in Devonshire, now at Court,
hurrying hither and thither, his horse and he one
veritable centaur. Among the Euphuistic 'tears of
fancy' which he sent from the Tower, there occurs this
little sentence, breathing the most complete sincerity:
'I live to trouble you at this time, being become like a
fish cast on dry land, gasping for breath, with lame legs
and lamer lungs.' There was no man then in England
whom it was more cruel to shut up in a cage. This
reference to his lungs is the first announcement of the
failure of his health. Raleigh's constitution was tough,
but he had a variety of ailments, and a tendency to
rheumatism and to consumption was among them. In
later years we shall find that the damp cells of the
Tower filled his joints with pain, and reduced him with
a weakening cough. But long before his main imprisonment
his joints and his lungs were troublesome to
him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the great privateering expedition in
which Raleigh had launched his fortune was proceeding
to its destination in the Azores. No such enterprise
had been as yet undertaken by English adventurers.
It was a strictly private effort, but the Queen in her
personal capacity had contributed two ships and 1,800<i>l.</i>,
and the citizens of London 6,000<i>l.</i>, but Raleigh retained
by far the largest share. Raleigh had been a week in
the Tower, when Admiral Sir John Burrough, who had
divided the fleet and had left Frobisher on the coast of
Spain, joined to his contingent two London ships, the
'Golden Dragon' and the 'Prudence,' and lay in wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
under Flores for the great line of approaching carracks.
The largest of these, the 'Madre de Dios,' was the most
famous plate-ship of the day, carrying what in those days
seemed almost incredible, no less than 1,800 tons.
Her cargo, brought through Indian seas from the coast
of Malabar, was valued when she started at 500,000<i>l.</i>
She was lined with glowing woven carpets, sarcenet
quilts, and lengths of white silk and cyprus; she carried
in chests of sandalwood and ebony such store of rubies
and pearls, such porcelain and ivory and rock crystal,
such great pots of musk and planks of cinnamon, as had
never been seen on all the stalls of London. Her hold
smelt like a garden of spices for all the benjamin and
cloves, the nutmegs and the civet, the ambergris and
frankincense. There was a fight before Raleigh's ship
the 'Roebuck' could seize this enormous prize, yet
somewhat a passive one on the part of the lumbering
carrack, such a fight as may ensue between a great
rabbit and the little stoat that sucks its life out. When
she was entered, it was found that pilferings had gone
on already at every port at which she had called; and
the English sailors had done their share before Burrough
could arrive on board; the jewels and the lighter spices
were badly tampered with, but in the general rejoicing
over so vast a prize this was not much regarded.
Through seas so tempestuous that it seemed at one time
likely that she would sink in the Atlantic, the 'Madre
de Dios' was at last safely brought into Dartmouth, on
September 8.</p>

<p>The arrival of the 'Madre de Dios' on the Queen's
birthday had something like the importance of a
national event. No prize of such value had ever been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
captured before. When all deduction had been made
for treasure lost or pilfered or squandered, there yet
remained a total value of 141,000<i>l.</i> in the money of
that day. The fact that all this wealth was lying in
Dartmouth harbour was more than the tradesmen of
London could bear. Before the Queen's commissioners
could assemble, half the usurers and shopkeepers in the
City had hurried down into Devonshire to try and gather
up a few of the golden crumbs. Raleigh, meanwhile,
was ready to burst his heart with fretting in the Tower,
until it suddenly appeared that this very concourse and
rabble at Dartmouth would render his release imperative.
No one but he could cope with Devonshire in its
excitement, and Lord Burghley determined on sending
him to Dartmouth. Robert Cecil, writing from Exeter
to his father on September 19, reported that for seven
miles everybody he met on the London road smelt of
amber or of musk, and that you could not open a bag
without finding seed-pearls in it. 'My Lord!' he says,
'there never was such spoil.' Raleigh's presence was
absolutely necessary, for Cecil could do nothing with
the desperate and obstinate merchants and sailors.</p>

<p>On September 21, Raleigh arrived at Dartmouth
with his keeper, Blount. Cecil was amazed to find the
disgraced favourite so popular in Devonshire. 'I assure
you,' he says, 'his poor servants to the number of one
hundred and forty, goodly men, and all the mariners,
came to him with such shouts and joy as I never saw a
man more troubled to quiet them in my life. But his
heart is broken, for he is extremely pensive longer than
he is busied, in which he can toil terribly, but if you
did hear him rage at the spoils, finding all the short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
wares utterly devoured, you would laugh as I do, which
I cannot choose. The meeting between him and Sir
John Gilbert was with tears on Sir John's part; and
he belike finding it known he had a keeper, wherever
he is saluted with congratulation for liberty, he doth
answer, "No, I am still the Queen of England's poor
captive." I wished him to conceal it, because here it
doth diminish his credit, which I do vow to you before
God is greater among the mariners than I thought for.
I do grace him as much as I may, for I find him
marvellously greedy to do anything to recover the
conceit of his brutish offence.'</p>

<p>Raleigh broke into rage at finding so many of his
treasures lost, and he gave out that if he met with any
London jewellers or goldsmiths in Devonshire, were it
on the wildest heath in all the county, he would strip
them as naked as when they were born. He raved
against the commissioners and the captains, against
Cecil and against Cross. As was his wont, he showed
no tact or consideration towards those who were engaged
with or just above him; but about the end of September
business cooled his wrath, and he settled down to a
division of the prize. On September 27, the Commissioners
of Inquiry sent in to Burghley and Howard
a report of their proceedings with respect to the 'Madre
de Dios'; this report is signed by Cecil, Raleigh, Sir
Francis Drake, and three other persons. They had carried
on their search for stolen treasure so rigorously
that even the Admiral's chests were examined against
his will. They confess their disappointment at finding
in them nothing more tempting than some taffetas embroidered
with Chinese gold, and a bunch of seed-pearl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh now married or acknowledged
Elizabeth Throckmorton, and in February 1593 Sir
Robert Cecil procured some sort of surly recognition
of the marriage from the Queen. For this Lady Raleigh
thanks him in a strange flowery letter<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the 8th of
that month, in which she excuses her husband for his
denial of her&mdash;'if faith were broken with me, I was
yet far away'&mdash;and shows an affectionate solicitude for
his future. It seems that Raleigh's first idea on finding
himself free was to depart on an expedition to America,
and this Lady Raleigh strongly objects to. In her
alembicated style she says to Cecil, 'I hope for my sake
you will rather draw for Walter towards the east than
help him forward toward the sunset, if any respect to
me or love to him be not forgotten. But every month
hath his flower and every season his contentment, and
you great councillors are so full of new councils, as you
are steady in nothing, but we poor souls that have
bought sorrow at a high price, desire, and can be pleased
with, the same misfortune we hold, fearing alterations
will but multiply misery, of which we have already felt
sufficient.' The poor woman had her way for the
present, and for two full years her husband contented
himself with a quiet and obscure life among the woods
of Sherborne.</p>

<p>For the next year we get scanty traces of Raleigh's
movements from his own letters. In May 1593 his
health, shaken by his imprisonment, gave him some
uneasiness, and he went to Bath to drink the waters,
but without advantage. In August of that year we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
find him busy in Gillingham Forest, and he gives Sir
Robert Cecil a roan gelding in exchange for a rare
Indian falcon. In the autumn he is engaged on the
south coast in arranging quarrels between English and
French fishermen. In April 1594 he captures a live
Jesuit, 'a notable stout villain,' with all 'his copes and
bulls,' in Lady Stourton's house, which was a very warren
of dangerous recusants. But he soon gets tired of these
small activities. The sea at Weymouth and at Plymouth
put out its arms to him and wooed him. To
hunt 'notable Jesuit knaves' and to sit on the granite
judgment-seat of the Stannaries were well, but life
offered more than this to Raleigh. In June 1594 he
tells Cecil that he will serve the Queen as a poor private
mariner or soldier if he may only be allowed to be
stirring abroad, and the following month there is a still
more urgent appeal for permission to go with the Lord
Admiral to Brittany. He has a quarrel meanwhile with
the Dean and Chapter of Sarum, who have let his
Sherborne farms over his head to one Fitzjames, and
'who could not deal with me worse withal if I were
a Turk.' But a month later release has come. The
plague has broken up his home, his wife and son are
sent in opposite directions, and he himself has leave to
be free at last; with God's favour and the Queen's he
will sail into 'the sunset' that Lady Raleigh had feared
so much, and will conquer for England the fabulous
golden cities of Guiana.</p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>GUIANA.</h3>


<p>The vast tract in the north-east of the southern continent
of America which is now divided between Venezuela
and three European powers, was known in the
sixteenth century by the name of Guiana. Of this
district the three territories now styled English, Dutch,
and French Guiana respectively form but an insignificant
coast-line, actually lying outside the vague eastern
limit of the traditional empire of Guiana. As early
as 1539 a brother of the great Pizarro had returned
to Peru with a legend of a prince of Guiana whose body
was smeared with turpentine and then blown upon with
gold dust, so that he strode naked among his people
like a majestic golden statue. This prince was El Dorado,
the Gilded One. But as time went on this title was
transferred from the monarch to his kingdom, or rather
to a central lake hemmed in by golden mountains in
the heart of Guiana. Spanish and German adventurers
made effort after effort to reach this <i>laguna</i>, starting
now from Peru, now from Quito, now from Trinidad,
but they never found it: little advance was made in
knowledge or authority, nor did Spain raise any definite
pretensions to Guiana, although her provinces
hemmed it in upon three sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that Raleigh, who followed with
the closest attention the nascent geographical literature
of his time, read the successive accounts which the
Spaniards and Germans gave of their explorations in
South America. But it was not until 1594 that he
seems to have been specially attracted to Guiana. At
every part of his career it was 'hatred of the tyrannous
prosperity' of Spain which excited him to action.
Early in 1594 Captain George Popham, sailing apparently
in one of Raleigh's vessels, captured at sea and
brought to the latter certain letters sent home to the
King of Spain announcing that on April 23, 1593, at
a place called Warismero, on the Orinoco, Antonio de
Berreo, the Governor of Trinidad, had annexed Guiana
to the dominions of his Catholic Majesty, under the
name of El Nuevo Dorado. In these same letters
various reports of the country and its inhabitants were
repeated, that the chiefs danced with their naked bodies
gleaming with gold dust, and with golden eagles dangling
from their breasts and great pearls from their ears, that
there were rich mines of diamonds and of gold, that the
innocent people were longing to exchange their jewels
for jews-harps. Raleigh was aroused at once, less by
the splendours of the description than by the fact
that this unknown country, with its mysterious possibilities,
had been impudently added to the plunder of
Spain. He immediately fitted out a ship, and sent
Captain Jacob Whiddon, an old servant of his, to act as
a pioneer, and get what knowledge he could of Guiana.
Whiddon went to Trinidad, saw Berreo, was put off by
him with various treacherous excuses, and returned to
England in the winter of 1594 with but a scanty stock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of fresh information. It was enough, however, to encourage
Raleigh to start for Guiana without delay.</p>

<p>On December 26 he writes: 'This wind breaks my
heart. That which should carry me hence now stays
me here, and holds seven ships in the river of Thames.
As soon as God sends them hither I will not lose one
hour of time.' On January 2, 1595, he is still at Sherborne,
'only gazing for a wind to carry me to my destiny.'
At last, on February 6 he sailed away from Plymouth,
not with seven, but with five ships, together with small
craft for ascending rivers. What the number of his
crew was, he nowhere states. The section of them
which he took up to the Orinoco he describes as 'a
handful of men, being in all about a hundred gentlemen;
soldiers, rowers, boat-keepers, boys, and all sorts.'
Sir Robert Cecil was to have adventured his own ship,
the 'Lion's Whelp,' and for her Raleigh waited seven
or eight days among the Canaries, but she did not arrive.
On the 17th they captured at Fuerteventura two ships,
Spanish and Flemish, and stocked their own vessels with
wine from the latter.</p>

<p>They then sailed on into the west, and on March 22
arrived on the south side of Trinidad, casting anchor on
the north shore of the Serpent's Mouth. Raleigh personally
explored the southern and western coasts of the
island in a small boat, while the ships kept to the channel.
He was amazed to find oysters in the brackish creeks
hanging to the branches of the mangrove trees at low
water, and he examined also the now famous liquid pitch
of Trinidad. Twenty years afterwards, in writing <i>The
History of the World</i>, we find his memory still dwelling
on these natural wonders. At the first settlement the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
English fleet came to, Port of Spain, they traded with the
Spanish colonists, and Raleigh endeavoured to find out
what he could, which was but little, about Guiana. He
pretended that he was asking merely out of curiosity,
and was on his way to his own colony of Virginia.</p>

<p>While Raleigh was anchored off Port of Spain, he
found that Berreo, the Governor, had privately sent
for reinforcements to Marguerita and Cumana, meaning
to attack him suddenly. At the same time the Indians
came secretly aboard the English ships with terrible
complaints of Spanish cruelty. Berreo was keeping
the ancient chiefs of the island in prison, and had
the singular foible of amusing himself at intervals by
basting their bare limbs with broiling bacon. These
considerations determined Raleigh to take the initiative.
That same evening he marched his men up the country
to the new capital of the island, St. Joseph, which
they easily stormed, and in it they captured Berreo.
Raleigh found five poor roasted chieftains hanging in
irons at the point of death, and at their instance he set
St. Joseph on fire. That very day two more English
ships, the 'Lion's Whelp' and the 'Galleys,' arrived at
Port of Spain, and Raleigh was easily master of the
situation.</p>

<p>Berreo seems to have submitted with considerable
tact. He insinuated himself into Raleigh's confidence,
and, like the familiar poet in Shakespeare's sonnet,
'nightly gulled him with intelligence.' His original
idea probably was that by inflaming Raleigh's imagination
with the wonders of Guiana, he would be the
more likely to plunge to his own destruction into the
fatal swamps of the Orinoco. It is curious to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
even Raleigh, who was eminently humane in his own
dealings with the Indians, speaking in these terms
of such a cruel scoundrel as Berreo, 'a gentleman
well descended, very valiant and liberal, and a gentleman
of great assuredness, and of a great heart: I
used him according to his estate and worth in all
things I could, according to the small means I had.'
Berreo showed him a copy he held of a journal kept by
a certain Juan Martinez, who professed to have penetrated
as far as Manoa, the capital of Guiana. This
narrative was very shortly afterwards exposed as 'an
invention of the fat friars of Puerto Rico,' but Raleigh
believed it, and it greatly encouraged him. When
Berreo realised that he certainly meant to attempt the
expedition, his tone altered, and he 'was stricken into a
great melancholy and sadness, using all the arguments
he could to dissuade me, and also assuring the gentlemen
of my company that it would be labour lost,' but
all in vain.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to cross the Serpent's
Mouth, and to ascend one of the streams of the great
delta. Raleigh sent Captain Whiddon to explore the
southern coast, and determined from his report to take
the Capuri, or, as it is now called, the Macareo branch,
which lies directly under the western extremity of
Trinidad. After an unsuccessful effort here, he started
farther west, on the Ca&ntilde;o Manamo, which he calls the
River of the Red Cross. He found it exceedingly difficult
to enter, owing to the sudden rise and fall of the
flood in the river, and the violence of the current. At
last they started, passing up the river on the tide, and
anchoring in the ebb, and in this way went slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
onward. The vessels which carried them were little
fitted for such a task. Raleigh had had an old galley
furnished with benches to row upon, and so far cut
down that she drew but five feet of water; he had
also a barge, two wherries, and a ship's boat, and in
this miserable fleet, leaving his large vessels behind
him in the Gulf of Paria, he accomplished his perilous
and painful voyage to the Orinoco and back, with one
hundred persons and their provisions. Of the misery of
these four hundred miles he gives a graphic account:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We were all driven to lie in the rain and weather, in the
open air, in the burning sun, and upon the hard boards, and
to dress our meat, and to carry all manner of furniture,
wherewith [the boats] were so pestered and unsavoury, that
what with victuals being most fish, with the wet clothes of
so many men thrust together, and the heat of the sun, I
will undertake there was never any prison in England that
could be found more unsavoury and loathsome, especially
to myself, who had for many years before been dieted and
cared for in a sort far different.</p></div>

<p>On the third day, as they were ascending the river,
the galley stuck so fast that they thought their expedition
would have ended there; but after casting out all
her ballast, and after much tugging and hauling to and
fro, they got off in twelve hours. When they had
ascended beyond the limit of the tide, the violence of
the current became a very serious difficulty, and at the
end of the seventh day the crews began to despair, the
temperature being extremely hot, and the thick foliage
of the Ita-palms on either side of the river excluding
every breath of air. Day by day the Indian pilots
assured them that the next night should be the last.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Raleigh had to harangue his men to prevent mutiny,
for now their provisions also were exhausted. He told
them that if they returned through that deadly swamp
they must die of starvation, and that the world would
laugh their memory to scorn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 678px;">

<span class="caption">GUIANA.</span>
</div>

<p>Presently things grew a little better. They found
wholesome fruits on the banks, and now that the streams
were purer they caught fish. Not knowing what they
saw, they marvelled at the 'birds of all colours, some
carnation, orange tawny,' which was Raleigh's own
colour, 'purple, green, watchet and of all other sorts
both simple and mixed, as it was unto us a great good
passing of the time to behold them, besides the relief
we found by killing some store of them with our fowling
pieces.' These savannahs are full of birds, and the
brilliant macaws which excited Raleigh's admiration
make an excellent stew, with the flavour, according to
Sir Robert Schomburgk, of hare soup. Their pilot now
persuaded them to anchor the galley in the main river,
and come with him up a creek, on the right hand, which
would bring them to a town. On this wild-goose chase
they ascended the side-stream for forty miles; it was
probably the Cucuina, which was simply winding back
with them towards the Gulf of Paria. They felt that
the Indian was tricking them, but about midnight,
while they were talking of hanging him, they saw a
light and heard the baying of dogs. They had found
an Indian village, and here they rested well, and had
plenty of food and drink. Upon this new river they
were charmed to see the deer come feeding down to
the water's brink, and Raleigh describes the scene as
though it reminded him of his own park at Sherborne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
They were alarmed at the crowds of alligators, and
one handsome young negro, who leaped into the river
from the galley, was instantly devoured in Raleigh's
sight.</p>

<p>Next day they regained the great river, and their
anxious comrades in the 'Lion's Whelp.' They passed
on together, and were fortunate enough to meet with
four Indian canoes laden with excellent bread. The
Indians ran away and left their possessions, and
Raleigh's dreams of mineral wealth were excited by the
discovery of what he took to be a 'refiner's basket, for
I found in it his quicksilver, saltpetre, and divers things
for the trial of metals, and also the dust of such ore as
he had refined.' He was minded to stay here and dig
for gold, but was prevented by a phenomenon which he
mentions incidentally, but which has done much to
prove the reality of his narrative. He says that all the
little creeks which ran towards the Orinoco 'were raised
with such speed, as if we waded them over the shoes
in the morning outward, we were covered to the
shoulders homeward the very same day.' Sir R. Schomburgk
found exactly the same to be the case when he
explored Guiana in 1843.</p>

<p>They pushed on therefore along the dreary river, and
on the fifteenth day had the joy of seeing straight
before them far away the peaks of Peluca and Paisapa,
the summits of the Imataca mountains which divide
the Orinoco from the Essequibo. The same evening,
favoured by a strong northerly wind, they came in sight
of the great Orinoco itself, and anchored in it a little to
the east of the present settlement of San Rafael de
Barrancas. Their spirits were high again. They feasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
on the eggs of the freshwater turtles which they found
in thousands on the sandy islands, and they gazed with
rapture on the mountains to the south of them which
rose out of the very heart of Guiana. A friendly chieftain
carried them off to his village, where, to preserve the
delightful spelling of the age, 'some of our captaines
garoused of his wine till they were reasonable pleasant,'
this wine being probably the cassivi or fermented juice
of the sweet potato. It redounds to Raleigh's especial
credit that in an age when great license was customary
in dealing with savages, he strictly prohibited his men,
under threat of punishment by death, from insulting
the Indian women. His just admiration of the fair
Caribs, however, was quite enthusiastic:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The casique that was a stranger had his wife staying at
the port where we anchored, and in all my life I have seldom
seen a better-favoured woman. She was of good stature,
with black eyes, fat of body, of an excellent countenance,
and taking great pride therein. I have seen a lady in
England so like her, as but for the difference of colour I
would have sworn might have been the same.</p></div>

<p>They started to ascend the Orinoco, having so little
just understanding of the geography of South
America that they thought if they could only sail far
enough up the river they would come out on the other
side of the continent at Quito. It has been noticed that
Raleigh passed close to the Spanish settlement of
Guayana Vieja, which Berreo had founded four years
before. Perhaps it was by this time deserted, and
Raleigh may really have gone by it without seeing it.
More probably, however, its existence interfered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
his theory that all this territory was untouched by
Europeans, and therefore open to be annexed in the
name of her English Majesty. Passing up the Orinoco,
he came at last to what he calls 'the port of Morequito,'
where he made some stay, and enjoyed the luxury of
pine-apples, which he styles 'the princess of fruits.'
He was also introduced to that pleasing beast the armadillo,
whose powers and functions he a little misunderstood,
for he says of it, 'it seemeth to be all barred over
with small plates like to a rhinoceros, with a white horn
growing in his hinder parts, like unto a hunting horn,
which they use to wind instead of a trumpet.' What
Raleigh mistook for a hunting-horn was the stiff tail of
the armadillo. Raleigh warned the peaceful and friendly
inhabitants of Morequito against the villanies of Spain,
and recommended England to them as a safe protector.
He then pursued his westerly course to an island which
he calls Caiama, and which is now named Fajardo,
which was the farthest point he reached upon the
Orinoco. This island lies at the mouth of the Caroni,
the great southern artery of the watershed, and Raleigh's
final expedition was made up this stream. He reached
the foot of the great cataract, now named Salto Caroni,
and his description of this noble natural wonder may be
quoted as a favourable instance of his style, and as the
crown of his geographical enterprise:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When we ran to the tops of the first hills of the plains
adjoining to the river, we behold that wonderful breach of
waters, which ran down Caroli [Caroni]; and might from
that mountain see the river how it ran in three parts, above
twenty miles off, and there appeared some ten or twelve
overfalls in sight, every one as high over the other as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
church tower, which fell with that fury that the rebound
of waters made it seem as if it had been all covered over
with a great shower of rain; and in some places we took it
at the first for a smoke that had risen over some great town.
For mine own part, I was well persuaded from thence to
have returned, being a very ill footman, but the rest were all
so desirous to go near the said strange thunder of waters,
that they drew me on by little and little, till we came into
the next valley, where we might better discern the same.
I never saw a more beautiful country, nor more lively
prospects, hills so raised here and there over the valleys, the
river winding into divers branches, the plains adjoining
without bush or stubble, all fair green grass, the ground of
hard sand easy to march on either for horse or foot, the
deer crossing in every path, the birds towards the evening
singing on every tree with a thousand several tunes, cranes
and herons of white, crimson, and carnation perching on the
river's side, the air fresh with a gentle easterly wind, and
every stone that we stooped to take up promised either gold
or silver by his complexion.</p></div>

<p>The last touch spoils an exquisite picture. It is at
once dispiriting to find so intrepid a geographer and so
acute a merchant befooled by the madness of gold, and
pathetic to know that his hopes in this direction were
absolutely unfounded. The white quartz of Guiana,
the 'hard white spar' which Raleigh describes, confessedly
contains gold, although, as far as is at present
known, in quantities so small as not to reward working.
Humboldt says that his examination of Guiana gold
led him to believe that, 'like tin, it is sometimes disseminated
in an almost imperceptible manner in the
mass of granite rocks itself, without our being able to
admit that there is a ramification and an interlacing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
small veins.' It is plain that Raleigh got hold of unusually
rich specimens of the sparse auriferous quartz.
He was accused on his return of having brought his
specimens from Africa, but no one suggested that they
did not contain gold. No doubt much of the sparkling
dust he saw in the rocks was simply iron pyrites, or
some other of the minerals which to this day are known
to the wise in California as 'fool's gold.' His expedition
had come to America unprovided with tools of
any kind, and Raleigh confesses that such specimens of
ore as they did not buy from the Indians, they had to
tear out with their daggers or with their fingers.</p>

<p>It has been customary of late, in reaction against the
defamation of Raleigh in the eighteenth century, to
protest that gold was not his chief aim in the Guiana
enterprise, but that his main wish, under cover of
the search for gold, was to form a South American
colony for England, and to open out the west to
general commerce. With every wish to hold this
view, I am unable to do so in the face of the existing
evidence. More humane, more intelligent than any of
the adventurers who had preceded him, it yet does not
seem that Raleigh was less insanely bitten with the
gold fever than any of them. He saw the fleets of
Spain return to Europe year after year laden with
precious metals from Mexico, and he exaggerated, as all
men of his age did, the power of this tide of gold. He
conceived that no one would stem the dangerous influence
of Spain until the stream of wealth was diverted
or divided. He says in the most direct language that
it is not the trade of Spain, her exports of wines
and Seville oranges and other legitimate produce, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
threatens shipwreck to us all; 'it is his Indian gold that
endangereth and disturbeth all the nations of Europe;
it purchased intelligence, creepeth into councils, and
setteth bound loyalty at liberty in the greatest monarchies
of Europe.' In Raleigh's exploration of Guiana,
his steadfast hope, the hope which led him patiently
through so many hardships, was that he might secure
for Elizabeth a vast auriferous colony, the proceeds of
which might rival the revenues of Mexico and Peru.
But we must not make the mistake of supposing him
to have been so wise before his time as to perceive that
the real wealth which might paralyse a selfish power
like that of Spain would consist in the cereals and other
products which such a colony might learn to export.</p>

<p>Resting among the friendly Indians in the heart of
the strange country to which he had penetrated, Raleigh
became in many ways the victim of his ignorance and
his pardonable credulity. Not only was he gulled with
diamonds and sapphires that were really rock-crystals,
but he was made to believe that there existed west of
the Orinoco a tribe of Indians whose eyes were in
their shoulders, and their mouths in the middle of their
breasts. He does not pretend that he saw such folks,
however, or that he enjoyed the advantage of conversing
with any of the Ewaipanoma, or men without heads, or
of that other tribe, 'who have eminent heads like dogs,
and live all the day-time in the sea, and speak the
Carib language.' Of all these he speaks from modest
hearsay, and less confidently than Othello did to Desdemona.
It is true that he relates marvellous and
fabulous things, but it is no less than just to distinguish
very carefully between what he repeats and what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
reports. For the former we have to take the evidence
of his interpreters, who but dimly understood what the
Indians told them, and Raleigh cannot be held personally
responsible; for the latter, the testimony of all later
explorers, especially Humboldt and Schomburgk, is that
Raleigh's narrative, where he does not fall into obvious
and easily intelligible error, is remarkably clear and
simple, and full of internal evidence of its genuineness.</p>

<p>They had now been absent from their ships for
nearly a month, and Raleigh began to give up all hope
of being able on this occasion to reach the city of Manoa.
The fury of the Orinoco began to alarm them; they did
not know what might happen in a country subject to
such sudden and phenomenal floods. Tropical rains fell
with terrific violence, and the men would get wetted to
the skin ten times a day. It was cold, it was windy,
and to push on farther seemed perfectly hopeless.
Raleigh therefore determined to return, and they glided
down the vast river at a rapid pace, without need of sail
or oar. At Morequito, Raleigh sent for the old Indian
chief, Topiawari, who had been so friendly to him before,
and had a solemn interview with him. He took him
into his tent, and shutting out all other persons but
the interpreter, he told him that Spain was the enemy
of Guiana, and urged him to become the ally of England.
He promised to aid him against the Epuremi, a native
race which had oppressed him, if Topiawari would in
his turn act in Guiana for the Queen of England. To
this the old man and his followers warmly assented,
urging Raleigh to push on, if not for Manoa, at least for
Macureguarai, a rich city full of statues of gold, that was
but four days' journey farther on. This, Raleigh, in con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>sideration
of the sufferings of his followers, declined to
do, but he consented to an odd exchange of hostages, and
promised the following year to make a better equipped
expedition to Manoa. He carried off with him the son
of Topiawari, and he left behind at Morequito a boy
called Hugh Goodwin. To keep this boy company, a
young man named Francis Sparrey volunteered to stay
also; he was a person of some education, who had served
with Captain Gifford. Goodwin had a fancy for learning
the Indian language, and when Raleigh found him at
Caliana twenty-two years later, he had almost forgotten
his English. He was at last devoured by a jaguar.
Sparrey, who 'could describe a country with his pen,'
was captured by the Spaniards, taken to Spain, and
after long sufferings escaped to England, where he
published an account of Guiana in 1602. Sparrey is
chiefly remembered by his own account of how he purchased
eight young women, the eldest but eighteen
years of age, for a red-hafted knife, which in England
had cost him but a halfpenny. This was not the sort
of trade which Raleigh left him behind to encourage.</p>

<p>As they passed down the Orinoco, they visited a
lake where Raleigh saw that extraordinary creature the
manatee, half cow, half whale; and a little lower they
saw the column of white spray, rising like the tower of
a church, over the huge cascades of the crystal mountains
of Roraima. At the village of a chieftain within earshot
of those thundering waters, they witnessed one of
the wild drinking feasts of the Indians, who were 'all
as drunk as beggars, the pots walking from one to
another without rest.' Next day, the contingent led
by Captain Keymis found them, and to celebrate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
meeting of friends, they passed over to the island of
Assapana, now called Yayo, in the middle of the Orinoco,
and they enjoyed a feast of the flesh of armadillos. On the
following day, increased cold and violent thunderstorms
reminded them that the autumn was far spent, and they
determined to return as quickly as possible to the sea.
Their pilots told them, however, that it was out of the
question to try to descend the River of the Red Cross,
which they had ascended, as the current would baffle
them; and therefore they attempted what is now called
the Macareo channel, farther east. Raleigh names this
stream the Capuri.</p>

<p>They had no further adventures until they reached
the sea; but as they emerged into the Serpent's Mouth,
a great storm attacked them. They ran before night
close under shore with their small boats, and brought
the galley as near as they could. The latter, however,
very nearly sank, and Raleigh was puzzled what to do.
A bar of sand ran across the mouth of the river, covered
by only six feet of water, and the galley drew five. The
longer he hesitated, the worse the weather grew, and
therefore he finally took Captain Gifford into his own
barge, and thrust out to sea, leaving the galley anchored
by the shore. 'So being all very sober and melancholy,
one faintly cheering another to show courage, it pleased
God that the next day, about nine of the clock, we
descried the island of Trinidad, and steering for the
nearest part of it, we kept the shore till we came to
Curiapan, where we found our ships at anchor, than
which there was never to us a more joyful sight.'</p>

<p>In spite of the hardships of the journey, the constant
wettings, the bad water and insufficient food, the lodging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
in the open air every night, he had only lost a single
man, the young negro who was snapped up by the
alligator at the mouth of the Cucuina. At the coast
there are dangerous miasmata which often prove fatal
to Europeans, but the interior of this part of South
America is reported by later travellers to be no less
wholesome than Raleigh found it.</p>

<p>During Raleigh's absence his fleet had not lain idle
at Trinidad. Captain Amyas Preston, whom he had left
in charge, determined to take the initiative against the
Spanish forces which Berreo had summoned to his help.
With four ships Preston began to harry the coast of
Venezuela. On May 21 he appeared before the important
town of Cumana, but was persuaded to spare it
from sack upon payment of a large sum by the inhabitants.
Captain Preston landed part of his crew here,
and they crossed the country westward to Caracas,
which they plundered and burned. The fleet proceeded
to Coro, in New Granada, which they treated in the
same way. When they returned is uncertain, but
Raleigh found them at Curiapan when he came back to
Trinidad, and with them he coasted once more the
northern shore of South America. He burned Cumana,
but was disappointed in his hopes of plunder, for he
says, 'In the port towns of the province of Vensuello
[Venezuela] we found not the value of one real of plate.'
The fact was that the repeated voyages of the English
captains&mdash;and Drake was immediately to follow in
Raleigh's steps&mdash;had made the inhabitants of these
northern cities exceedingly wary. The precious products
were either stored in the hills, or shipped off to Spain
without loss of time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Raleigh's return to England was performed without
any publicity. He stole home so quietly that some
people declared that he had been all the time snug
in some Cornish haven. His biographers, including
Mr. Edwards, have dated his return in August, being
led away by a statement of Davis's, manifestly inaccurately
dated, that Raleigh and Preston were sailing off
the coast of Cuba in July. This is incompatible with
Raleigh's fear of the rapid approach of winter while he
was still in Guiana. It would also be difficult to account
for the entire absence of reference to him in England
before the winter. It is more likely that he found his
way back into Falmouth or Dartmouth towards the end
of October 1595. On November 10, he wrote to Cecil,
plainly smarting under the neglect which he had received.
He thought that coming from the west, with an
empire in his hand as a gift for Elizabeth, the Queen
would take him into favour again, but he was mistaken.
He writes to Cecil nominally to offer his services against
a rumoured fleet of Spain, but really to feel the ground
about Guiana, and the interest which the Government
might take in it. 'What becomes of Guiana I much
desire to hear, whether it pass for a history or a fable.
I hear Mr. Dudley [Sir Robert Dudley] and others are
sending thither; if it be so, farewell all good from
thence. For although myself, like a cockscomb, did
rather prefer the future in respect of others, and rather
sought to win the kings to her Majesty's service than to
sack them, I know what others will do when those kings
shall come singly into their hands.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had been writing an account of his
travels, and on November 13, 1595, he sent a copy of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
this in manuscript to Cecil, no doubt in hope that it
might be shown to Elizabeth. In the interesting letter
which accompanied this manuscript he inclosed a map of
Guiana, long supposed to have been lost, which was found
by Mr. St. John in the archives of Simancas, signed with
Raleigh's name, and in perfect condition. It is evident
that Raleigh could hardly endure the disappointment of
repulse. He says, 'I know the like fortune was never
offered to any Christian prince,' and losing his balance
altogether in his extravagant pertinacity, he declares to
Cecil that the city of Manoa contains stores of golden
statues, not one of which can be worth less than
100,000<i>l.</i> If the English Government will not prosecute
the enterprise that he has sketched out, Spain and
France will shortly do so, and Raleigh, in the face of
such apathy, 'concludes that we are cursed of God.'
Amid all this excitement, it is pleasant to find him
remembering to be humane, and begging Cecil to
impress the Queen with the need of 'not soiling this
enterprise' with cruelty; nor permitting any to proceed
to Guiana whose object shall only be to plunder the
Indians. He sends Cecil an amethyst 'with a strange
blush of carnation,' and another stone, which 'if it be
no diamond, yet exceeds any diamond in beauty.'</p>

<p>Raleigh now determined to appeal to the public at
large, and towards Christmas 1595 he published his
famous volume, which bears the date 1596, and is
entitled, after the leisurely fashion of the age, <i>The Discovery
of the large, rich, and beautiful Empire of Guiana,
with a Relation of the Great and Golden City of Manoa,
which the Spaniards call El Dorado, and the Provinces
of Emeria, Arromaia, Amapaia, and other Countries, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
their Rivers, adjoining</i>. Of this volume two editions
appeared in 1596, it was presently translated into Latin
and published in Germany, and in short gained a reputation
throughout Europe. There can be no doubt that
Raleigh's outspoken hatred of Spain, expressed in this
printed form, from which there could be no escape on the
ground of mere hearsay, was the final word of his challenge
to that Power. From this time forth Raleigh was
an enemy which Spain could not even pretend to ignore.</p>

<p>The <i>Discovery of Guiana</i> was dedicated to the
Lord Admiral Howard and to Sir Robert Cecil, with
a reference to the support which the author had
found in their love 'in the darkest shadow of adversity.'
There was probably some courtly exaggeration, mingled
with self-interest, in the gratitude expressed to Cecil.
Already the relation of this cold-blooded statesman to
the impulsive Raleigh becomes a crux to the biographers
of the latter. Cecil's letters to his father from Devonshire
on the matter of the Indian carracks in 1592 are
incompatible with Raleigh's outspoken thanks to Cecil
for the trial of his love when Raleigh was bereft of all
but malice and revenge, unless we suppose that these
letters represented what Burghley would like to hear
rather than what Robert Cecil actually felt. In 1596
Burghley, in extreme old age, was a factor no longer to
be taken into much consideration. Moreover, Lady
Raleigh had some hold of relationship or old friendship
on Cecil, the exact nature of which it is not easy to
understand. At all events, as long as Raleigh could
hold the favour of Cecil, the ear of her Majesty was not
absolutely closed to him.</p>

<p>The <i>Discovery</i> possesses a value which is neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
biographical nor geographical. It holds a very prominent
place in the prose literature of the age. During
the five years which had elapsed since Raleigh's last
publication, English literature had been undergoing a
marvellous development, and he who read everything
and sympathised with every intellectual movement
could not but be influenced by what had been written.
During those five years, Marlowe's wonderful career had
been wound up like a melodrama. Shakespeare had
come forward as a poet. A new epoch in sound English
prose had been inaugurated by Hooker's <i>Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>. Bacon was circulating the earliest of his <i>Essays</i>.
What these giants of our language were doing for
their own departments of prose and verse, Raleigh did
for the literature of travel. Among the volumes of
navigations, voyages, and discoveries, which were poured
out so freely in this part of the reign of Elizabeth, most
of them now only remembered because they were
reprinted in the collections of Hakluyt and Purchas,
this book of Raleigh's takes easily the foremost position.
In comparison with the bluff and dull narratives of the
other discoverers, whose chief charm is their na&iuml;vet&eacute;,
the <i>Discovery of Guiana</i> has all the grace and fullness
of deliberate composition, of fine literary art, and as
it was the first excellent piece of sustained travellers'
prose, so it remained long without a second in our
literature. The brief examples which it has alone been
possible to give in this biography, may be enough to
attract readers to its harmonious and glowing pages.</p>

<p>Among the many allusions found to this book in
contemporary records, perhaps the most curious is an
epic poem on Guiana, published almost immediately by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
George Chapman, who gave his enthusiastic approval to
Raleigh's scheme. It is the misfortune of Chapman's
style that in his grotesque arrogance he disdained to be
lucid, and this poem is full of tantalising hints, which
the biographer of Raleigh longs to use, but dares not,
from their obscurity. These stately verses are plain
enough, but show that Chapman was not familiar with
the counsels of Elizabeth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then in the Thespiads' bright prophetic font,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I see our Liege rise from her throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ears and thoughts in steep amaze erect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the most rare endeavour of her power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now she blesses with her wonted graces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The industrious knight, the soul of this exploit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismissing him to convoy of his stars:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chapman was quite misinformed; and to what event
he now proceeds to refer, it would be hard to say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now for love and honour of his wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our twice-born nobles bring him, bridegroom like,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is espoused for virtue to his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With feasts and music ravishing the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his Argolian fleet; where round about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bating colours English valour swarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In haste, as if Guianian Orenoque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his full waters fell upon our shore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Early in 1596, Raleigh sent Captain Lawrence
Keymis, who had been with him the year before, on a
second voyage to Guiana. He did not come home rich,
but he did the special thing he was enjoined to do&mdash;that
is to say, he explored the coast of South America from
the mouth of the Orinoco to that of the Amazon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
About the same time Raleigh drew up the very remarkable
paper, not printed until 1843, entitled <i>Of the Voyage
for Guiana</i>. In this essay he first makes use of those
copious quotations from Scripture which later on became
so characteristic of his writing. His hopes of interesting
the English Government in Guiana were finally
frustrated by the excitement of the Cadiz expedition,
and by the melancholy fate of Sir Francis Drake. It
is said that during this winter he lived in great magnificence
at Durham House, but this statement seems
improbable. All the letters of Raleigh's now in existence,
belonging to this period, are dated from Sherborne.</p>

<h3>CADIZ.</h3>


<p>The defeat of the Spanish Armada had inflicted a
wound upon the prestige of Spain which was terrible
but by no means beyond remedy. In the eight years
which had elapsed since 1588, Spain had been gradually
recovering her forces, and endangering the political
existence of Protestant Europe more and more. Again
and again the irresolution of Elizabeth had been called
upon to complete the work of repression, to crush the
snake that had been scotched, to strike a blow in Spanish
waters from which Spain never would recover. In 1587,
and in 1589, schemes for a naval expedition of this kind
had been brought before Council, and rejected. In
1596, Charles Lord Howard of Effingham, with the
support of Cecil, forced the Government to consent to
fit out an armament for the attack of Cadiz. The
Queen, however, was scarcely to be persuaded that the
expenditure required for this purpose could be spared
from the Treasury. On April 9, levies of men were
ordered from all parts of England, and on the 10th
these levies were countermanded, so that the messengers
sent on Friday from the Lords to Raleigh's deputies in
the West, were pursued on Saturday by other messengers
with contrary orders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The change of purpose, however, was itself promptly
altered, and the original policy reverted to. The Earl
of Essex was joined in commission with the Lord
Admiral Howard, and as a council of war to act with
these personages were named Sir Walter Raleigh and
Lord Thomas Howard. The Dutch were to contribute
a fleet to act with England. It is an interesting fact
that now for the first time the experience and naval
skill of Raleigh received their full recognition. From
the very first he was treated with the highest consideration.
Howard wrote to Cecil on April 16&mdash;and Essex
on the 28th used exactly the same words&mdash;'I pray you,
hasten away Sir Walter Raleigh.' They fretted to be
gone, and Raleigh was not to be found; malignant
spirits were not wanting to accuse him of design in his
absence, of a wish to prove himself indispensable. But
fortunately we possess his letters, and we see that he
was well and appropriately occupied. In the previous
November he had sent in to the Lords of the Council a
very interesting report on the defences of Cornwall and
Devon, which he had reason to suppose that Spain
meant to attack. He considered that three hundred
soldiers successfully landed at Plymouth would be
'sufficient to endanger and destroy the whole shire,'
and he discussed the possibility of levying troops from
the two counties to be a mutual protection. It was
doubtless his vigour and ability in performing this sort
of work which led to his being selected as the chief purveyor
of levies for the Cadiz expedition, and this was
what he was doing in the spring of 1596, when the
creatures of Essex whispered to one another that he
was malingering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 3, he wrote to Cecil: 'I am not able to
live, to row up and down every tide from Gravesend to
London, and he that lies here at Ratcliff can easily
judge when the rest, and how the rest, of the ships may
sail down.' And again, from a lower point of the
Thames, at Blackwall, he is still waiting for men and
ships that will not come, and is 'more grieved than ever
I was, at anything in this world, for this cross weather.'</p>

<p>Through the month of May, we may trace Raleigh
hard at work, recruiting for the Cadiz expedition round
the southern coast, of England. On the 4th he is at
Northfleet, disgusted to find how little her Majesty's
authority is respected, for 'as fast as we press men one
day, they come away another, and say they will not
serve. I cannot write to our generals at this time, for
the Pursuevant found me at a country village, a mile
from Gravesend, hunting after runaway mariners, and
dragging in the mire from alehouse to alehouse, and
could get no paper.' On the 6th he was at Queenborough,
on the 13th at Dover, whence he reports
disaster by a storm on Goodwin Sands, and finally on
the 21st he arrived at Plymouth. His last letters are
full of recommendations of personal friends to appointments
in the gift or at the command of Sir Robert
Cecil. He brought with him to Plymouth two of
Bacon's cousins, the Cookes, and his own wife's brother,
Arthur Throckmorton. Unfortunately, just as the fleet
was starting, the last-mentioned, 'a hot-headed youth,'
in presence not only of the four generals, but of the
commanders of the Dutch contingent also, took Raleigh's
side in some dispute at table so intemperately and loudly
that he was dismissed from the service. This must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
have been singularly annoying to Raleigh, who nevertheless
persuaded his colleagues, no doubt on receipt of
due apology, to restore the young man to his rank, and
allow him to proceed. At Cadiz, Throckmorton fought
so well that Essex himself knighted him.</p>

<p>The generals had other troubles at Plymouth. The
men that Raleigh had pressed along the coast hated
their duty, and some of them had to be tried for desertion
and mutiny. Before the fleet got under way,
two men were publicly hanged, to encourage the others,
'on a very fair and pleasant green, called the Hoe.'
At last, on June 1, the squadrons put to sea. Contrary
winds kept them within Plymouth Sound until the 3rd.
On the 20th they anchored in the bay of St. Sebastian,
half a league to the westward of Cadiz. The four English
divisions of the fleet contained in all ninety-three vessels,
and the Dutch squadron consisted of twenty-four more.
There were about 15,500 men, that is to say 2,600
Dutchmen, and the rest equally divided between English
soldiers and sailors.</p>

<p>The events of the next few days were not merely a
crucial and final test of the relative strength of Spain
and England, closing in a brilliant triumph for the
latter, but to Raleigh in particular they were the climax
of his life, the summit of his personal prosperity and
glory. The records of the battle of Cadiz are exceedingly
numerous, and were drawn up not by
English witnesses only, but by Dutch and Spanish
historians also. Mr. Edwards has patiently collected
them all, and he gives a very minute and lucid account
of their various divergencies. Of them all the most full
and direct is that given by Raleigh himself, in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
<i>Relation of the Action in Cadiz Harbour</i>, first published
in 1699. In a biography of Raleigh it seems but
reasonable to view such an event as this from Raleigh's
own standpoint, and the description which now follows
is mainly taken from the <i>Relation</i>. The joint fleet
paused where the Atlantic beats upon the walls of Cadiz,
and the Spanish President wrote to Philip II. that they
seemed afraid to enter. He added that it formed <i>la
mas hermosa armada que se ha visto</i>, the most beautiful
fleet that ever was seen; and that it was French as well
as English and Dutch, which was a mistake.</p>

<p>Raleigh's squadron was not part of the fleet that
excited the admiration of Gutierrez Flores. On the 19th
he had been detached, in the words of his instructions,
'with the ships under his charge, and the Dutch
squadron, to anchor near the entrance of the harbour,
to take care that the ships riding near Cadiz do not
escape,' and he took up a position that commanded
St. Lucar as well as Cadiz. He was 'not to fight,
except in self-defence,' without express instructions.
At the mouth of St. Lucar he found some great ships,
but they lay so near shore that he could not approach
them, and finally they escaped in a mist, Raleigh very
nearly running his own vessel aground. Meanwhile
Essex and Charles Howard, a little in front of him,
came to the conclusion in his absence that it would be
best to land the soldiers and assault the town, without
attempting the Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>Two hours after this determination had been arrived
at, much to the dismay of many distinguished persons in
the fleet whose position did not permit them to expostulate,
Raleigh arrived to find Essex in the very act of dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>embarking
his soldiers. There was a great sea on from the
south, and some of the boats actually sank in the waves,
but Essex nevertheless persisted, and was about to effect
a landing west of the city. Raleigh came on board the
'Repulse,' 'and in the presence of all the colonels protested
against the resolution,' showing Essex from his
own superior knowledge and experience that by acting
in this way he was running a risk of overthrowing 'the
whole armies, their own lives, and her Majesty's future
safety.' Essex excused himself, and laid the responsibility
on the Lord Admiral.</p>

<p>Raleigh having once dared to oppose the generals,
he received instant moral support. All the other commanders
and gentlemen present clustered round him
and entreated him to persist. Essex now declared
himself convinced, and begged Raleigh to repeat his
arguments to the Lord Admiral. Raleigh passed on to
Howard's ship, 'The Ark Royal,' and by the evening
the Admiral also was persuaded. Returning in his
boat, as he passed the 'Repulse' Raleigh shouted up to
Essex 'Intramus,' and the impetuous Earl, now as eager
for a fight by sea as he had been a few hours before for
a fight by land, flung his hat into the sea for joy, and
prepared at that late hour to weigh anchor at once.</p>

<p>It took a good deal of time to get the soldiers out of
the boats, and back into their respective ships. Essex,
whom Raleigh seems to hint at under the cautious
word 'many,' 'seeming desperately valiant, thought it a
fault of mine to put off [the attack] till the morning;
albeit we had neither agreed in what manner to fight,
nor appointed who should lead, and who should second,
whether by boarding or otherwise.' Raleigh, in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
element when rapid action was requisite, passed to and
fro between the generals, and at last from his own ship
wrote a hasty letter to the Lord Admiral, giving his
opinion as to the best way to arrange the order of battle,
and requesting him to supply a couple of great fly-boats
to attack each of the Spanish galleons, so that the
latter might be captured before they were set on fire.</p>

<p>Essex and Howard were completely carried away by
Raleigh's vehement counsels. The Lord Admiral had
always shown deference to Raleigh's nautical science, and
the Earl was captivated by the qualities he could best
admire, courage and spirit and rapidity. Raleigh's old
faults of stubbornness and want of tact abandoned him
at this happy moment. His graceful courtesy to Essex,
his delicacy in crossing dangerous ground, won praise
even from his worst enemies, the satellites of Essex. It
was Raleigh's blossoming hour, and all the splendid
gifts and vigorous charms of his brain and character
expanded in the sunrise of victory. Late in the busy
evening of the 20th, the four leaders held a final council
of war, amiably wrangling among themselves for the
post of danger. At last the others gave way to what
Raleigh calls his 'humble suit,' and it was decided that
he should lead the van. Essex, Lord Howard of
Effingham, and the Vice-Admiral, Lord Thomas Howard,
were to lead the body of the fleet; but it appeared next
morning that the Vice-Admiral had but seemed to give
way, and that his ambition was still to be ahead of Raleigh
himself. As Raleigh returned to sleep on board the
'War Sprite,' the town of Cadiz was all ablaze with
lamps, tapers, and tar barrels, while there came faintly
out to the ears of the English sailors a murmur of wild
festal music.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day was the 21st of June. As Mr. St. John
pleasantly says, 'that St. Barnabas' Day, so often the
brightest in the year, was likewise the brightest of
Raleigh's life.' At break of day, the amazed inhabitants
of Cadiz, and the sailors who had caroused all night on
shore and now hurried on board the galleons, watched
the magnificent squadron sweep into the harbour of
their city. First came the 'War Sprite' itself; next
the 'Mary Rose,' commanded by Sir George Carew;
then Sir Francis Vere in the 'Rainbow,' carrying a
sullen heart of envy with him; then Sir Robert Southwell
in the 'Lion,' Sir Conyers Clifford in the 'Dreadnought,'
and lastly, as Raleigh supposed, Robert Dudley (afterwards
Duke of Northumberland, and a distinguished
author on naval tactics) in the 'Nonparilla.' As a
matter of fact, the Vice-Admiral, hoping to contrive to
push in front, had persuaded Dudley to change ships
with him. These six vessels were well in advance of
all the rest of the fleet. In front of them, ranged under
the wall of Cadiz, were seventeen galleys lying with
their prows to flank the English entrance, as Raleigh
ploughed on towards the galleons. The fortress of St.
Philip and other forts along the wall began to scour
the channel, and with the galleys concentrated their
fire upon the 'War Sprite.' But Raleigh disdained to
do more than salute the one and then the other with
a contemptuous blare of trumpets. 'The "St. Philip,"'
he says, 'the great and famous Admiral of Spain, was
the mark I shot at, esteeming those galleys but as wasps
in respect of the powerfulness of the others.'</p>

<p>The 'St. Philip' had a special attraction for him.
It was six years since his dear friend and cousin, Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Richard Grenville, under the lee of the Azores, with one
little ship, the 'Revenge,' had been hemmed in and
crushed by the vast fleet of Spain, and it was the 'St.
Philip' and the 'St. Andrew' that had been foremost
in that act of murder. Now before Raleigh there rose
the same lumbering monsters of the deep, that very
'St. Philip' and 'St. Andrew' which had looked down
and watched Sir Richard Grenville die, 'as a true soldier
ought to do, fighting for his country, queen, religion,
and honour.' It seems almost fabulous that the hour
of pure poetical justice should strike so soon, and that
Raleigh of all living Englishmen should thus come face
to face with those of all the Spanish tyrants of the deep.
As he swung forward into the harbour and saw them
there before him, the death of his kinsman in the
Azores was solemnly present to his memory, 'and being
resolved to be revenged for the "Revenge," or to second
her with his own life,' as he says, he came to anchor
close to the galleons, and for three hours the battle with
them proceeded.</p>

<p>It began by the 'War Sprite' being in the centre
and a little to the front; on the one side, the 'Nonparilla,'
in which Raleigh now perceived Lord Thomas
Howard, and the 'Lion;' on the other the 'Mary Rose'
and the 'Dreadnought;' these, with the 'Rainbow' a
little farther off, kept up the fight alone until ten o'clock
in the morning; waiting for the fly-boats, which were
to board the galleons, and which, for some reason or
other, did not arrive. Meanwhile, Essex, excited
beyond all restraint by the volleys of culverin and
cannon, slipped anchor, and passing from the body of
the fleet, lay close up to the 'War Sprite,' pushing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the 'Dreadnought' on one side. Raleigh, seeing him
coming, went to meet him in his skiff, and begged him
to see that the fly-boats were sent, as the battery was
beginning to be more than his ships could bear. The
Lord Admiral was following Essex, and Raleigh passed
on to him with the same entreaty. This parley between
the three commanders occupied about a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the men second in command had taken
an unfair advantage of Raleigh's absence. He hurried
back to find that the Vice-Admiral had pushed the
'Nonparilla' ahead, and that Sir Francis Vere, too, in
the 'Rainbow,' had passed the 'War Sprite.' Finding
himself, 'from being the first to be but the third,' Raleigh
skilfully thrust in between these two ships, and threw
himself in front of them broadside to the channel, so
that, as he says, 'I was sure no one should outstart me
again, for that day.' Finally, Essex and Lord Thomas
Howard took the next places. Sir Francis Vere, the
marshal, who seems to have been mad for precedence,
'while we had no leisure to look behind us, secretly
fastened a rope on my ship's side toward him, to draw
himself up equally with me; but some of my company
advertising me thereof, I caused it to be cut off, and so
he fell back into his place, whom I guarded, all but his
very prow, from the sight of the enemy.' In his
<i>Commentaries</i> Vere has his revenge, and carefully disparages
Raleigh on every occasion.</p>

<p>For some reason or other, the fly-boats continued to
delay, and Raleigh began to despair of them. What
he now determined to do, and what revenge he took for
Sir Richard Grenville, may best be told in his own
vigorous language:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Having no hope of my fly-boats to board, and the Earl
and my Lord Thomas having both promised to second me,
I laid out a warp by the side of the 'Philip' to shake hands
with her&mdash;for with the wind we could not get aboard;
which when she and the rest perceived, finding also that the
'Repulse,' seeing mine, began to do the like, and the rear-admiral
my Lord Thomas, they all let slip, and ran aground,
tumbling into the sea heaps of soldiers, as thick as if coals
had been poured out of a sack in many ports at once, some
drowned and some sticking in the mud. The 'Philip' and
the 'St. Thomas' burned themselves; the 'St. Matthew'
and the 'St. Andrew' were recovered by our boats ere they
could get out to fire them. The spectacle was very lamentable
on their side, for many drowned themselves, many,
half-burned, leaped into the water; very many hanging by
the ropes' end, by the ships' side, under the water even to
the lips; many swimming with grievous wounds, stricken
under water, and put out of their pain; and withal so huge
a fire, and such tearing of the ordnance in the great 'Philip'
and the rest, when the fire came to them, as, if a man had a
desire to see Hell itself, it was there most lively figured.
Ourselves spared the lives of all, after the victory, but the
Flemings, who did little or nothing in the fight, used
merciless slaughter, till they were by myself, and afterwards
by my Lord Admiral, beaten off.</p></div>

<p>The official report of the Duke of Medina Sidonia to
Philip II. does not greatly differ from this, except that
he says that the English set fire to the 'St. Philip.'
Before the fight was over Raleigh received a very serious
flesh wound in the leg, 'interlaced and deformed with
splinters,' which made it impossible for him to get on
horseback. He was, therefore, to his great disappointment,
unable to take part in Essex's land-attack on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
town. He could not, however, bear to be left behind,
and in a litter he was carried into Cadiz. He could
only stay an hour on shore, however, for the agony in
his leg was intolerable, and in the tumultuous disorder
of the soldiers, who were sacking the town, there was
danger of his being rudely pushed and shouldered. He
went back to the 'War Sprite' to have his wound
dressed and to sleep, and found that in the general
rush on shore his presence in the fleet was highly
desirable.</p>

<p>Early next morning, feeling eased by a night's rest,
he sent on shore to ask leave to follow the fleet of forty
carracks bound for the Indies, which had escaped down
the Puerto Real river; this navy was said to be worth
twelve millions. In the confusion, however, there came
back no answer from Essex or Howard. A ransom of
two millions had meanwhile been offered for them, but
this also, in the absence of his chiefs, Raleigh had no
power to accept. While he was thus uncertain, the
Duke of Medina Sidonia solved the difficulty on June
23, by setting the whole flock of helpless and treasure-laden
carracks on fire. From the deck of the 'War
Sprite' Raleigh had the mortification of seeing the
smoke of this priceless argosy go up to heaven. The
waste had been great, for of all the galleons, carracks,
and frigates of which the great Spanish navy had consisted,
only the 'St. Matthew' and the 'St. Andrew'
had come intact into the hands of the English. The
Dutch sailors, who held back until the fight was decided,
sprang upon the blazing 'St. Philip,' and saved a great
part of her famous store of ordnance; while, as Raleigh
pleasantly puts it, 'the two Apostles aforesaid' were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
richly furnished, and made an agreeable prize to bring
back to England.</p>

<p>The English generals, engaged in sacking the
palaces and razing the fortifications of Cadiz, were
strangely indifferent to the anxieties of their friends at
home. In England the wildest rumours passed from
mouth to mouth, but it was a fortnight before anyone
on the spot thought it necessary to communicate with
the Home Government. It is said that Raleigh's letter
to Cecil, written ten leagues to the west of Cadiz, on
July 7, and carried to England by Sir Anthony Ashley,
contained the first intimation of the victory. In this
letter Raleigh is careful to do himself justice with the
Queen, and to claim a complete pardon on the score of
services so signal, for it was already patent to him that
on a field where every man that would be helped must
help himself, his wounded leg had shut him out of all
hope of plunder. The cause of his standing so far as ten
leagues away from shore was that an epidemic had
broken out on board his ship. It proved impossible to
cope with this disease, and so it was determined that
on August 1 the 'War Sprite' should return to England,
in company with the 'Roebuck' and the 'John and
Francis.' On the sixth day they arrived in Plymouth,
and Raleigh found that, although seven weeks had
elapsed since the victory, no authentic account of it had
hitherto reached the Council. He was not well, and instead
of posting up to London, where he easily perceived
he would not be welcome, he asked pardon for staying
with his ship. On August 12 he landed at Weymouth,
and passed home to Sherborne. The rest of the fleet
came back later in the autumn, and Essex, as he passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the coast of Portugal, swooped down upon the famous
library of the Bishop of Algarve, which he presented on
his return to Sir Thomas Bodley. The Bodleian Library
at Oxford is now the chief existing memorial of that
glorious expedition to Cadiz which shattered the naval
strength of Spain.</p>

<p>As to prize-money, there proved to be very little of
it for the captors. It was understood that the Lord
Admiral was to have 5,000<i>l.</i>, Essex as much, and
Raleigh 3,000<i>l.</i>; but Essex, in his proud way, waived
his claim in favour of the Queen, just in time to escape
spoliation, for Elizabeth claimed everything. Her
scandalous avarice had grown upon her year by year,
and now in her old age her finer and more generous
qualities were sapped by her greed for money. Even
her political acumen had failed her; she was unable to
see, in her vexation at the loss of the Indian carracks,
that the blow to Spain had been one which relieved
her of a constant and immense anxiety. She determined
that no one should be the richer or the nobler
for a victory which had resulted in the destruction of
so much treasure which might have flowed into her
coffers. Deeply disappointed at the Queen's surly ingratitude,
Raleigh, whom she still refused to see, retired
for the next nine months into absolute seclusion at
Sherborne.</p>

<p>In his retirement Raleigh continued to remember
that his function was, as Oldys put it, 'by his extraordinary
undertakings to raise a grove of laurels, in a
manner out of the seas, that should overspread our
island with glory.' In October 1596 he was preparing
for his third expedition to Guiana, which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
placed under the command of Captain Leonard Berrie.
This navigator was absent until the summer of the
following year, when he returned, not having penetrated
to Manoa, but confirming with an almost obsequious
report Raleigh's most golden dreams. It is at this
time, after his return from Cadiz, that we find Sir
Walter Raleigh's name mentioned most lavishly by the
literary classes in their dedications and eulogistic addresses.
Whether his popularity was at the same time
high with the general public is more easily asserted
than proved, but there is no doubt that the victory at
Cadiz was highly appreciated by the mass of Englishmen,
and it is not possible but that Raleigh's prominent
share in it should be generally recognised.</p>

<p>On January 24, 1597, Raleigh wrote from Sherborne
a letter of sympathy to Sir Robert Cecil, on the death
of his wife. It is interesting as displaying Raleigh's
intimacy with the members of a family which was
henceforth to hold a prominent place in the chronicle
of his life, since it was Henry Brooke, Lady Cecil's
brother, who became, two months later, at the death of
his father, Lord Cobham. It was he and his brother
George Brooke who in 1603 became notorious as the
conspirators for Arabella Stuart, and who dragged
Raleigh down with them. We do not know when
Raleigh began to be intimate with the Brookes, and it
is just at this time, when his fortunes had reached their
climacteric, and when it would be of the highest importance
to us to follow them closely, that his personal
history suddenly becomes vague. If Cecil's letters to
him had been preserved we should know more. As it
is we can but record certain isolated facts, and make as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
much use of them as we can venture to do. In May
1597, nearly five years after his expulsion, we find him
received again at Court. Rowland White says, 'Sir
Walter Raleigh is daily in Court, and a hope is had
that he shall be admitted to the execution of his office
as Captain of the Guard, before he goes to sea.'</p>

<p>Cecil and Howard of Effingham had obtained this
return to favour for their friend, and Essex, although his
momentary liking for Raleigh had long subsided, did
not oppose it. He could not, however, be present when
Timias was taken back into the arms of his pardoning
Belph&oelig;be. On June 1, the Earl of Essex rode down to
Chatham, and during his absence Sir Walter Raleigh
was conducted by Cecil into the presence of the Queen.
She received him very graciously, and immediately authorised
him to resume his office of Captain of the Guard.
Without loss of time, Raleigh filled up the vacancies in
the Guard that very day, and spent the evening riding
with her Majesty. Next morning he made his appearance
in the Privy Chamber as he had been wont to do,
and his return to favour was complete. Essex showed,
and apparently felt, no very acute chagrin. He was
busy in planning another expedition against Spain, and
he needed Raleigh's help in arranging for the victualling
of the land forces. In July all jealousies seemed laid
aside, and the gossips of the Court reported, 'None but
Cecil and Raleigh enjoy the Earl of Essex, they carry
him away as they list.'</p>

<p>It lies far beyond the scope of the present biography to
discuss the obscure question of 'the conceit of <i>Richard the
Second</i>' with which these three amused themselves just
before the Islands Voyage began. The bare facts are these.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
On July 6, 1597, Raleigh wrote to Cecil from Weymouth
about the preparations for the expedition, and added: 'I
acquainted the Lord General [Essex] with your letter to
me, and your kind acceptance of your entertainment;
he was also wonderful merry at your conceit of <i>Richard
the Second</i>. I hope it shall never alter, and whereof
I shall be most glad of, as the true way to all our good,
quiet, and advancement, and most of all for His sake
whose affairs shall thereby find better progression.'
From this it would seem as though Cecil had offered a
dramatic entertainment to Essex and Raleigh on their
leaving town. This entertainment evidently consisted
of Shakespeare's new tragedy, then being performed at
the Globe Theatre and to be entered for publication
just a month later. When this play was printed it did
not contain what is called the 'Deposition Scene,' but
it would appear that this was given on the boards at the
time when Raleigh refers to it. It will be remembered
that in 1601 the lawyers accused Essex of having
feasted his eyes beforehand with a show of the dethronement
of his liege; but Raleigh's words do not suggest
any direct disloyalty.</p>

<p>Raleigh was in a state of considerable excitement at
the prospect of the new expedition. Cecil wrote, 'Good
Mr. Raleigh wonders at his own diligence, as if diligence
and he were not familiars;' and the fact that
Raleigh would sometimes write twice and thrice to him
in one day, and on a single occasion at least, four times,
proves that Cecil had a right to use this mild sarcasm.
Several months before, Raleigh had attempted by his
manifesto entitled <i>The Spanish Alarum</i> to stir up the
Government to be in full readiness to guard against a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
revengeful invasion of England by her old enemy. He
had thought out the whole situation, he had planned the
defences of England by land and sea, and his new
favour at Court had enabled him to put pressure on the
royal parsimony, and to insist that things should be done
as he saw fit. He was perfectly right in thinking that
Philip II. would rather suffer complete ruin than not
try once more to recover his position in Europe, but he
saw that the late losses at Cadiz would force the
Catholic king to delay his incursion, and he counselled a
rapid and direct second attack on Spain. As soon as ever
he was restored to power, he began to victual a fleet of
ten men-of-war with biscuit, beef, bacon, and salt fish,
and to call for volunteers. As the scheme seized the
popular mind, however, it gathered in extent, and it
was finally decided to fit up three large squadrons, with
a Dutch contingent of twelve ships. These vessels met
in Plymouth Sound.</p>

<p>On the night of Sunday, July 10, the fleet left
Plymouth, and kept together for twenty-four hours.
On the morning of the 12th, after a night of terrific
storm, Raleigh found his squadron of four ships parted
from the rest, and in the course of the next day only
one vessel beside his own was in sight. This tempest
was immortalised in his earliest known poem by John
Donne, who was in the expedition, and was described by
Raleigh as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The storm on Wednesday grew more forcible, and the
seas grew very exceeding lofty, so that myself and the
Bonaventure had labour enough to beat it up. But the
night following, the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, the
storm so increased, the ships were weighty, the ordnance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
great, and the billows so raised and enraged, that we could
carry out no sail which to our judgment would not have
been rent off the yards by the wind; and yet our ships
rolled so vehemently, and so disjointed themselves, that we
were driven either to force it again with our courses, or to
sink. In my ship it hath shaken all her beams, knees, and
stanchions well nigh asunder, in so much on Saturday night
last we made account to have yielded ourselves up to God.
For we had no way to work, either by trying, hauling, or
driving, that promised better hope, our men being worsted
with labour and watchings, and our ship so open everywhere,
all her bulkheads rent, and her very cook-room of

<p>Such were the miseries of navigation in the palmy
days of English adventure by sea. The end of it was
that about thirty vessels crept back to Falmouth and
Tor Bay, some were lost altogether, and Raleigh, with
the remainder, found harbour on July 18 at Plymouth.
For a month they lay there, recovering their forces, and
Essex, whose own ship was at Falmouth, came over to
Plymouth and was Raleigh's guest on the 'War Sprite.'
Raleigh writes to Cecil: 'I should have taken it unkindly
if my Lord had taken up any other lodging till the "Lion"
come: and now her Majesty may be sure his Lordship
shall sleep somewhat the sounder, though he fare the
worse, by being with me, for I am an excellent watchman
at sea.' In this same letter, dated July 26, 1597,
the fatal name of Cobham first appears in the correspondence
of Raleigh: 'I pray vouchsafe,' he says, 'to
remember me in all affection to my Lord Cobham.'</p>

<p>On August 18, in the face of a westerly wind, the
fleet put out once more from Plymouth. In the Bay of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Biscay the 'St. Andrew' and the 'St. Matthew' were
disabled, and had to be left behind at La Rochelle. Off
the coast of Portugal, Raleigh himself had a serious
accident, for his mainyard snapped across, and he had
to put in for help by the Rock of Lisbon, in company
with the 'Dreadnought.' Essex left a letter saying
that Raleigh must follow him as fast as he could to the
Azores, and on September 8 the 'War Sprite' came in
view of Ter&ccedil;eira. On the 15th Raleigh's squadron joined
the main fleet under Essex at Flores.</p>

<p>The distress of the voyage and its separations had
told upon the temper of Essex, while he was surrounded
by those who were eager to poison his mind with suspicion
of Raleigh. When the latter dined with Essex in the
'Repulse' on the 15th, the Earl with his usual impulsiveness
made a clean breast of his 'conjectures and
surmises,' letting Raleigh know the very names of those
scandalous and cankered persons who had ventured to
accuse him, and assuring him that he rejected their
counsel. On this day or the next a pinnace from India
brought the news that the yearly fleet was changing its
usual course, and would arrive farther south in the
Azores. A council of war was held in the 'Repulse,'
and it was resolved to divide the archipelago among the
commanders. Fayal was to be taken by Essex and
Raleigh, Graciosa by Howard and Vere, San Miguel by
Mountjoy and Blount, while Pico, with its famous wines,
was left for the Dutchmen. Essex sailed first, and left
Raleigh taking in provisions at Flores, where he dined
in a small inland town with his old acquaintance Lord
Grey, and others, including Sir Arthur Gorges, the
minute historian of the expedition. About midnight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
when they were safe in their ships again, Captain
Arthur Champernowne, Raleigh's kinsman, arrived with
a letter from Essex desiring Raleigh to come over to
Fayal at once, and complete his supplies there. With
his usual promptitude, he started instantly, and soon
outstripped Essex.</p>

<p>When Raleigh arrived in the great harbour of Fayal,
the peaceful look of everything assured him in a moment
that Essex had not yet been heard of. But no sooner
did the inhabitants perceive the 'War Sprite' and the
'Dreadnought,' than they began to throw up defences
and remove their valuables into the interior. It was in
the highest degree irksome to Raleigh to wait thus
inactive, while this handsome Spanish colony was
slipping from his clutch, but he had been forbidden to
move without orders. After three days' waiting for
Essex, a council of war was held on board the 'War
Sprite.' On the fourth Raleigh leaped into his barge
at the head of a landing company, refusing the help of
the Flemings who were with him, and stormed the cliffs.
It was comparatively easy to get his troops on shore,
but the Spaniards contested the road to the town inch
by inch. At last Raleigh and his four hundred and
fifty men routed their opponents and entered Fayal, a
town 'full of fine gardens, orchards, and wells of delicate
waters, with fair streets, and one very fair church;' and
allowed his men to plunder it. The English soldiers
slept that night in Fayal, and when they woke next
morning they saw the tardy squadron of Essex come
warping into the harbour at last. Sir Gilly Meyrick,
the bitterest of the parasites of Essex, slipped into a
boat and was on board the 'Repulse' as soon as she
anchored, reporting Raleigh's conduct to the Earl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Raleigh must have known that Essex was not the
man to be pleased at a feat which took all the credit of
the Islands Voyage out of his hands; but he feigned
unconsciousness. In his barge he came out from Fayal
to greet the Earl, and entered the General's cabin.
After a faint welcome, Essex began to reproach him
with 'a breach of Orders and Articles,' and to point out
to him that in capturing Fayal without authority he
had made himself liable to the punishment of death.
Raleigh replied that he was exempt from such orders,
being, in succession to Essex and Lord Howard, himself
commander of the whole fleet by the Queen's letters
patent. After a dispute of half an hour, Essex seemed
satisfied, and accepted an invitation to sup with Raleigh
on shore. But another malcontent, Sir Christopher
Blount, obtained his ear, and set his resentment blazing
once more. Essex told Raleigh he should not sup at
all that night. Raleigh left the 'Repulse,' and prepared
to separate his squadron from the fleet, lest an
attempt should be made to force him to undergo the
indignity of a court-martial. Howard finally made
peace between the two commanders, and Raleigh was
induced to give some sort of apology for his action.</p>

<p>The fleet proceeded to St. Miguel, when Raleigh was
left to watch the roadstead, while Essex pushed inland.
While Raleigh lay here, a great Indian carrack of
sixteen hundred tons, laden with spices, knowing
nothing of the English invasion, blundered into the
middle of what she took to be a friendly Spanish fleet.
She perceived her mistake just in time to run herself
ashore, and disembark her crew. Raleigh at the head
of a party of boats attempted to seize her, but her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
commander set her on fire, and when the Englishmen came
close to her she was one dangerous splendour of flaming
perfumes and roaring cannon. Raleigh was more fortunate
in securing another carrack laden with cochineal from
Cuba. The rest of the Islands Voyage was uneventful
and ill-managed. For some time nothing was heard of
the fleet in England, and Lady Raleigh 'skrebbled,' as
she spelt it, hasty notes to Cecil begging for news of
her husband. Early in October he came back to
England, seriously enfeebled in health. The only one
of the commanders who gained any advantage from the
Islands Voyage was the one who had undertaken least,
Lord Howard of Effingham, who was raised to the
earldom of Nottingham.</p>

<h3>LAST DAYS OF ELIZABETH.</h3>


<p>A slight anecdote, which is connected with the month
of January 1598, must not be omitted here. It gives
us an impression of the personal habits of Raleigh at
this stage of his career. It was the custom of the
Queen to go to bed early, and one winter's evening the
Earl of Southampton, Raleigh, and a man named Parker
were playing the game of primero in the Presence
Chamber, after her Majesty had retired. They laughed
and talked rather loudly, upon which Ambrose Willoughby,
the Esquire of the Body, came out and desired
them not to make so much noise. Raleigh pocketed
his money, and went off, but Southampton resented the
interference, and in the scuffle that ensued Willoughby
pulled out a handful of those marjoram-coloured curls
that Shakespeare praised.</p>

<p>It is not easy to see why it was, that in the obscure
year 1598, while the star of Essex was setting, that of
his natural rival did not burn more brightly. But
although now, and for the brief remainder of Elizabeth's
life, Raleigh was nominally in favour, the saturnine old
woman had no longer any tenderness for her Captain of
the Guard. Her old love, her old friendship, had quite
passed away. There was no longer any excuse for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
excluding from her presence so valuable a soldier and so
wise a courtier, but her pulses had ceased to thrill at
his coming. If Essex had been half so courteous, half
so assiduous as Raleigh, she would have opened her
arms to him, but she had offended Essex past forgiveness,
and his tongue held no parley with her. It
must have been in Raleigh's presence&mdash;for he it is who
has recorded it in the grave pages of his <i>Prerogative of
Parliament</i>&mdash;that Essex told the Queen 'that her conditions
were as crooked as her carcass,' a terrible speech
which, as Raleigh says, 'cost him his head.' This was
perhaps a little later, in 1600. In 1598 these cruel
squabbles were already making life at Court a misery.
The Queen kept Raleigh by her, but would give him
nothing. In January he applied for the post of Vice-chamberlain,
but without success. The new earl, Lord
Nottingham, could theatrically wipe the dust from
Raleigh's shoes with his cloak, but when Raleigh himself
desired to be made a peer, in the spring of 1598, he
was met with a direct refusal. He would fain have
been Lord Deputy in Ireland, but the Queen declined
to spare him. On the last day of August he was in
the very act of being sworn on the Privy Council, but
at the final moment Cecil frustrated this by saying
that if he were made a councillor, he must resign his
Captainship of the Guard to Sir George Carew. This
was, as Cecil was aware, too great a sacrifice to be
thought of, and the hero of Cadiz and Fayal, foiled on
every hand, had to submit to remain plain Sir Walter
Raleigh, Knight.</p>

<p>As the breach grew between Essex and the Queen,
the temper of the former grew more surly. He dropped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the semblance of civility to Raleigh. In his <i>Apothegms</i>,
Lord Bacon has preserved an amusing anecdote of
November 17, 1598. On this day, which was the
Queen's sixty-fifth birthday, the leading courtiers, as
usual, tilted in the ring in honour of their Liege; the
custom of this piece of mock chivalry demanded that
each knight should be disguised. It was, however,
known that Sir Walter Raleigh would ride in his own
uniform of orange tawny medley, trimmed with black
budge of lamb's wool. Essex, to vex him, came to the
lists with a body-guard of two thousand retainers all
dressed in orange tawny, so that Raleigh and his men
should seem a fragment of the great Essex following.
The story goes on to show that Essex digged a pit and
fell into it himself; but enough has been said to prove
his malignant intention. We have little else but anecdotes
with which to fill up the gap in Raleigh's career
between December 1597 and March 1600. This was an
exceedingly quiet period in his life, during which we
have to fancy him growing more and more at enmity
with Essex, and more and more intimate with Cobham.</p>

<p>In September 1598, an unexpected ally, the Duke
of Finland, urged Raleigh to undertake once more his
attempt to colonise Guiana, and offered twelve ships as
his own contingent. Two months later we find that
the hint has been taken, and that Sir John Gilbert is
'preparing with all speed to make a voyage to Guiana.'
It is said, moreover, that 'he intendeth to inhabit it
with English people.' He never started, however, and
Raleigh, referring long afterwards to the events of these
years, said that though Cecil seemed to encourage him
in his West Indian projects, yet that when it came to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the point he always, as Raleigh quaintly put it, retired
into his back-shop. Meanwhile, the interest felt in
Raleigh's narrative was increasing, and in 1599 the
well-known geographer Levinus Hulsius brought out
in Nuremburg a Latin translation of the <i>Discovery</i>, with
five curious plates, including one of the city of Manoa,
and another of the Ewaipanoma, or men without heads.
The German version of the book and its English reprint
in Hakluyt's <i>Navigations</i> belong to the same year. Also
in 1599, the <i>Discovery</i> was reproduced in Latin, German,
and French by De Bry in the eighth part of his celebrated
<i>Collectiones Peregrinationum</i>. This year, then, in which
we hardly hear otherwise of Raleigh, marked the height
of his success as a geographical writer. So absolutely
is the veil drawn over his personal history at this time
that the only facts we possess are, that on November 4
Raleigh was lying sick of an ague, and that on December
13 he was still ill.</p>

<p>In the middle of March 1600 Sir Walter and Lady
Raleigh left Durham House for Sherborne, taking with
them, as a playmate for their son Walter, Sir Robert
Cecil's eldest son, William, afterwards the second Earl
of Salisbury. On the way down to Dorsetshire, they
stopped at Sion House as the guests of the 'Wizard'
Earl of Northumberland, a life-long friend of Raleigh's,
and presently to be his most intelligent fellow-prisoner
in the Tower. From Sherborne, Raleigh wrote on the
6th of April saying frankly that if her Majesty persisted
in excluding him from every sort of preferment, 'I must
begin to keep sheep betime.' He hinted in the same
letter that he would accept the Governorship of Jersey,
which was expected to fall vacant. The friendship with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Lord Cobham has now become quite ardent, and Lady
Raleigh vies with her husband in urging him to pay
Sherborne a visit. Later on in April the Raleighs went
to Bath apparently for no other reason than to meet
Cobham there. Here is a curious note from Raleigh to
the most dangerous of his associates, written from Bath
on April 29, 1600:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here we attend you and have done this sevennight, and
we still mourn your absence, the rather because we fear that
your mind is changed. I pray let us hear from you at
least, for if you come not we will go hereby home, and make
but short tarrying here. My wife will despair ever to see
you in these parts, if your Lordship come not now. We can
but long for you and wish you as our own lives whatsoever.</p>

<p>Your Lordship's everest faithful, to honour you most,</p>

<p style="margin-left:40%;">
<span class="smcap">W. Ralegh.</span>
</p></div>

<p>Raleigh's absence from Court was so lengthy, that it
was whispered in the early summer that he was in
disgrace, that the Queen had called him 'something
worse than cat or dog,' namely, 'fox.' The absurdity of
this was proved early in July by his being hurriedly
called to town to accompany Cobham and Northumberland
on their brief and fruitless visit to Ostend. The
friends started from Sandwich on July 11, and were
received in the Low Countries by Lord Grey; they
were entertained at Ostend with extraordinary respect,
but they gained nothing of political or diplomatic value.
Affairs in Ireland, connected with the Spanish invasion,
occupied Raleigh's mind and pen during this autumn,
but he paid no visit to his Munster estates. There
were plots and counterplots developing in various parts of
these islands in the autumn of 1600, but with none of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
these subterranean activities is Raleigh for the present
to be identified.</p>

<p>When Sir Anthony Paulet died, on August 26,
1600, Raleigh had the satisfaction of succeeding him
in the Governorship of Jersey. He had asked for the
reversion of this post, and none could be found more
appropriate to his powers or circumstances. It gave
him once more the opportunity to cultivate his restless
energy, to fly hither and thither by sea and land, and
to harry the English Channel for Spaniards as a terrier
watches a haystack for rats. Weymouth, which was
the English postal port for Jersey, was also the natural
harbour of Sherborne, and Raleigh had been accustomed,
as it was, to keep more than one vessel there. The
appointment in Jersey was combined with a gift of the
manor of St. Germain in that island, but the Queen
thought it right, in consideration of this present, to
strike off three hundred pounds from the Governor's
salary. Cecil was Raleigh's guest at Sherborne when
the appointment was made, and Raleigh waited until
he left before starting for his new charge; all this time
young William Cecil continued at Sherborne for his
health. At last, late in September, Sir Walter and
Lady Raleigh went down to Weymouth, and took with
them their little son Walter, now about six years old. The
day was very fine, and the mother and son saw the new
Governor on board his ship. He was kept at sea forty-eight
hours by contrary winds, but reached Jersey at
last on an October morning.</p>

<p>Raleigh wrote home to his wife that he never saw a
pleasanter island than Jersey, but protested that it was
not in value the very third part of what had been reported.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
One of his first visits was to the castle of Mont Orgueil,
which had been rebuilt seven years before. His intention
had been to destroy it, but he was so much struck
with its stately architecture and commanding position
that he determined to spare it, and in fact he told off
a detachment of his men then and there to guard it.
Raleigh's work in Jersey was considerable. While he
remained governor, he established a trade between the
island and Newfoundland, undertook to register real
property according to a definite system, abolished the
unpopular compulsory service of the Corps de Garde, and
lightened in many directions the fiscal burdens which
previous governors had laid on the population. Raleigh's
beneficent rule in Jersey lasted just three years.</p>

<p>While he was absent on this his first visit to the
island, Lady Raleigh at Sherborne received news from
Cecil of the partial destruction of Durham House by a
fire, which had broken out in the old stables. None of
the Raleigh valuables were injured, but Lady Raleigh
suggests that it is high time something were definitely
settled about property in this 'rotten house,' which Sir
Walter was constantly repairing and improving without
possessing any proper lease of it. As a matter of fact,
when the crash came, Durham House was the first of
his losses. Early in November 1600, Raleigh was in
Cornwall, improving the condition of the tin-workers,
and going through his duties in the Stannaries Court of
Lostwithiel. We find him protecting private enterprise
on Roborough Down against the borough of Plymouth,
which desired to stop the tin-works, and the year closes
with his activities on behalf of the 'establishment of
good laws among tinners.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>The first two months of 1601 were occupied with
the picturesque tragedy of Essex's trial and execution.
It seems that Raleigh was at last provoked into open
enmity by the taunts and threats of the Lord Marshal.
Among the strange acts of Essex, none had been more
strange than his extraordinary way of complaining, like
a child, of anyone who might displease him. In his
letter to the Queen on June 25, 1599, he openly named
Raleigh and Cobham as his enemies and the enemies of
England; not reflecting that both of these personages
were in the Queen's confidence, and that he was out
of it. We may presume that it was more than Raleigh
could bear to be shown a letter addressed to the Queen
in which Essex deliberately accused him of 'wishing
the ill success of your Majesty's most important action,
the decay of your greatest strength, and the destruction
of your faithfullest servants.' There were some things
Raleigh could not forgive, and the accusation that he
favoured Spain was one of these. Shut up among his
creatures in his house in the Strand, and refused all
communication with Elizabeth, Essex thought no
accusation too libellous to spread against the trio who
held the royal ear, against Raleigh, Cecil, and Cobham,
whose daggers, he said, were thirsting for his blood.</p>

<p>It was probably in the summer of 1600 that Raleigh
wrote the curious letter of advice to Cecil which forms
the only evidence we possess that he had definitely come
to the decision that Essex must die. His language
admits of no doubt of his intention. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If you take it for a good counsel to relent towards this
tyrant, you will repent it when it shall be too late. His
malice is fixed, and will not evaporate by any of your mild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
courses. For he will ascribe the alteration to her Majesty's
pusillanimity and not to your good nature, knowing that
you work but upon her humour, and not out of any love
towards him. The less you make him, the less he shall be
able to harm you and yours; and if her Majesty's favour fail
him, he will again decline to a common person. For after-revenges,
fear them not, for your own father was esteemed
to be the contriver of Norfolk's ruin, yet his son followeth
your father's son and loveth him.</p></div>

<p>This advice has been stigmatised as worse than ungenerous.
It was, at all events, extremely to the point,
and it may be suggested that for Raleigh and Cecil the
time for showing generosity to Essex was past. They
took no overt steps, however, but it is plain that they
kept themselves informed of the mad meetings that went
on in Essex House. On the morning before the insurrection
was to break out, February 18, 1601, Raleigh sent
a note to his kinsman, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who was
one of Essex's men, to come down to Durham House to
speak with him. Gorges, startled at the message,
consulted Essex, who advised him to say that he would
meet Raleigh, not at Durham House, but half-way, on
the river. Raleigh assented to this, and came alone,
while Gorges, with two other gentlemen, met him.
Raleigh told his cousin that a warrant was out to seize
him, and advised him to leave London at once for
Plymouth. Gorges said it was too late, and a long conversation
ensued, in the course of which a boat was seen
to glide away from Essex stairs and to approach them.
Upon this Gorges pushed Raleigh's boat away, and bid
him hasten home. As he rowed off towards Durham
House, four shots from the second boat missed him; it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
had been manned by Sir Christopher Blount, who, with
three or four servants of Essex, had come out to capture
or else kill Raleigh.</p>

<p>For this treason Blount asked and obtained Raleigh's
pardon a few days later, on the scaffold. At the last
moment of his life, Essex also had desired to speak with
Raleigh, having already solemnly retracted the accusations
he had made against him; but it is said that this
message of peace was not conveyed to Raleigh until it
was too late. According to Raleigh's own account, he
had been standing near the scaffold, on purpose to see
whether Essex would address him, and had retired because
he was not spoken to. His words in 1618 were these:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is said I was a persecutor of my Lord of Essex; that
I puffed out tobacco in disdain when he was on the scaffold.
But I take God to witness I shed tears for him when he
died. I confess I was of a contrary faction, but I knew he
was a noble gentleman. Those that set me up against him,
did afterwards set themselves against me.</p></div>

<p>Raleigh was accused of barbarity by the adherents
of Essex, but there is nothing to rebut the testimony
of one of his own greatest enemies, Blount, who confessed,
a few minutes before he died, that he did not
believe Sir Walter Raleigh intended to assassinate the
Earl, nor that Essex himself feared it, 'only it was a
word cast out to colour other matters.' We are told
that Raleigh suffered from a profound melancholy as he
was rowed back from the Tower to Durham House after
the execution of Essex, and that it was afterwards
believed that he was visited at that time by a presentiment
of his own dreadful end.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1601, Raleigh became in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>volved
in a vexatious quarrel between certain of his own
Dorsetshire servants. The man Meeres, whom he had
appointed as bailiff of the Sherborne estates nine years
before, after doing trusty service to his master, had
gradually become aggressive and mutinous. He disliked
the presence of Adrian Gilbert, Raleigh's brother, who
had been made Constable of Sherborne Castle, and who
overlooked Meeres on all occasions. There began to be
constant petty quarrels between the bailiff of the manor
and the constable of the castle, and when Raleigh at
last dismissed the former bailiff and appointed another,
Meeres put himself under the protection of an old enemy
of Raleigh's, Lord Thomas Howard, now Lord Howard
of Bindon, and refused to quit. In the month of
August, Meeres audaciously arrested the rival bailiff,
whereupon Raleigh had Meeres himself put in the stocks
in the market-place of Sherborne. The town took
Raleigh's side, and when Meeres was released, the
people riotously accompanied him to his house, with
derisive cries. When Raleigh was afterward attainted,
Meeres took all the revenge he could, and succeeded in
making himself not a little offensive to Lady Raleigh.
Sir Walter Raleigh's letters testify to the great annoyance
this man gave him. It appears that Meeres' wife, 'a
broken piece, but too good for such a knave,' was a kinswoman
of Lady Essex, and the most curious point is
that Raleigh thought that Meeres was trained to forge
his handwriting. He tells Cecil:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Earl did not make show to like Meeres, nor admit
him to his presence, but it was thought that secretly he
meant to have used him for some mischief against me; and,
if Essex had prevailed, he had been used as the counterfeiter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
for he writes my hand so perfectly that I cannot any way
discern the difference.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>Meeres was ready in the law, and during the month
of September sent twenty-six subp&oelig;nas down to
Sherborne. But on October 3 he was subdued for the
time being, and wrote to Cecil from his prison in the
Gatehouse that he was very sorry for what he had said
so 'furiously and foolishly' about Sir Walter Raleigh,
and begged for a merciful consideration of it. He was
pardoned, but he proved a troublesome scoundrel then
and afterwards.</p>

<p>Early in September 1601, Raleigh came up on
business from Bath to London, meaning to return at
once, but found himself unexpectedly called upon to
stay and fulfil a graceful duty. Henry IV. of France,
being at Calais, had sent the Duc de Biron, with a
retinue of three hundred persons, to pay a visit of
compliment to Elizabeth. It was important that the
French favourite should be well received in England,
but no one expected him in London, and the Queen
was travelling. Sir Arthur Savage and Sir Arthur
Gorges were the Duke's very insufficient escort, until
Raleigh fortunately made his appearance and did the
honours of London in better style. He took the French
envoys to Westminster Abbey, and, to their greater
satisfaction, to the Bear Garden. The Queen was now
staying, as the guest of the Marquis of Winchester, at
Basing, and so, on September 9, Raleigh took the
Duke and his suite down to the Vine, a house in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Hampshire, where he was royally entertained. The
Queen visited them here, and on the 12th they all came
over to stay with her at Basing Park. By the Queen's
desire, Raleigh wrote to Cobham, who had stayed at
Bath, to come over to Basing and help to entertain
the Frenchmen; he added, that in three or four days
the visit would be over, and he and Cobham could go
back to Bath together. The letters of Raleigh display
an intimate friendship between Lord Cobham and himself
which is not to be overlooked in the light of coming
events. The French were all dressed in black, a colour
Raleigh did not possess in his copious wardrobe, so that
he had to order the making of a black taffeta suit in a
hurry, to fetch which from London he started back late
on Saturday night after bringing the Duke safe down
to Basing. It was on the next day, if the French
ambassador said true, that he had the astounding conversation
with Elizabeth about Essex, at the end of
which, after railing against her dead favourite, she
opened a casket and produced the very skull of Essex.
The subject of the fall of favourites was one in which
Biron should have taken the keenest interest. Ten
months later he himself, abandoned by his king, came
to that frantic death in front of the Bastille which
Chapman presented to English readers in the most
majestic of his tragedies. The visit to Elizabeth
occupies the third act of <i>Byron's Conspiracy</i>, which,
published in 1608, contains of course no reference to
Raleigh's part on that occasion.</p>

<p>It may be that in the autumn of 1601, James of
Scotland first became actively cognisant of Raleigh's
existence. Spain was once more giving Elizabeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
anxiety, and threatening an invasion which actually
took place on September 21, at Kinsale. By means
of the spies which he kept in the Channel, Raleigh saw
the Spanish fleet advancing, and warned the Government,
though his warnings were a little too positive in
pointing out Cork and Limerick as the points of attack.
Meanwhile, he wrote out for the Queen's perusal a State
paper on <i>The Dangers of a Spanish Faction in Scotland</i>.
This paper has not been preserved, but the rumour of its
contents is supposed to have frightened James in his
correspondence with Rome, and to have made him judge
it prudent to offer Elizabeth three thousand Scotch
troops against the invader. Raleigh's casual remarks
with regard to Irish affairs at this critical time, as we
find them in his letters to Cecil, are not sympathetic or
even humane, and there is at least one passage which
looks very much like a licensing of assassination; yet
it is certain that Raleigh, surveying from his remote
Sherborne that Munster which he knew so well, took in
the salient features of the position with extraordinary
success. In almost every particular he showed himself
a true prophet with regard to the Irish rising of 1601.</p>

<p>In November the Duke of Lennox came somewhat
hastily to London from Paris, entrusted with a very
delicate diplomatic commission from James of Scotland
to Elizabeth. It is certain that he saw Raleigh and
Cobham, and that he discussed with them the thorny
question of the succession to the English throne. It
moreover appears that he found their intentions
'traitorous to the King,' that is to say unfavourable to
the candidature of James. The whole incident is exceedingly
dark, and the particulars of it rest mainly on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
tainted authority, that of Lord Henry Howard. It may
be conjectured that what really happened was that the
Duke of Lennox, learning that Raleigh was in town,
desired Sir Arthur Savage to introduce him; that he
then suggested a private conference, which was first
refused, then granted, in Cobham's presence, at Durham
House; that Raleigh refused King James's offers, and
went and told Cecil that he had done so. Cecil, however,
chose to believe that Raleigh was keeping something
back from him, and his attitude from this moment
grows sensibly colder to Raleigh, and he speaks of
Raleigh's 'ingratitude,' though it is not plain what he
should have been grateful for to Cecil.</p>

<p>It was now thirteen years since Raleigh had abandoned
the hope of colonising Virginia, though his
thoughts had often reverted to that savage country, of
which he was the nominal liege lord. In 1602 he made
a final effort to assert his authority there. He sent out
a certain Samuel Mace, of whose expedition we know
little; and about the same time his nephew, Bartholomew
Gilbert, with an experienced mariner, Captain Gosnoll,
went to look for the lost colony and city of Raleigh.
These latter started in a small barque on March 26, but
though they enjoyed an interesting voyage, they never
touched Virginia at all. They discovered and named
Martha's Vineyard, and some other of the islands in the
same group; then, after a pleasant sojourn, they came
back to England, and landed at Exmouth on July 23.
It was left for another than Raleigh, while he was impoverished
and a prisoner in the Tower, to carry out
the dream of Virginian settlement. Perhaps the most
fortunate thing that could have happened to Raleigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
would have been for him to have personally conducted
to the West this expedition of 1602. To have been out
of England when the Queen died might have saved him
from the calumny of treason.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that Raleigh was a complete
loser by these vain expeditions. But a passage in a
letter of August 21, 1602, shows us that this was not
the fact. He says: 'Neither of them spake with the
people,' that is, with the lost Virginian colonists, 'but I
do send both the barques away again, having saved the
charge in sassafras wood.' From the same letter we
find that Gilbert and Gosnoll went off without Raleigh's
leave, though in his ship and at his expense, and the
latter therefore prays that his nephew may be stripped
of his rich store of sassafras and cedar wood, partly in
chastisement, but more for fear of overstocking the
London market. He throws Gilbert over, and speaks
angrily of him not as a kinsman, but as 'my Lord
Cobham's man;' then relents in a postscript&mdash;'<i>all</i> is
confiscate, but he shall have his part again.'</p>

<p>Raleigh was feeble in health and irritable in temper
all this time. Lady Raleigh, with a woman's instinct,
tried to curb his ambition, and tie him down to Sherborne.
'My wife says that every day this place amends,
and London, to her, grows worse and worse.' Meanwhile,
there is really not an atom of evidence to show
that Raleigh was engaged in any political intrigue. He
spent the summer and autumn of 1602, when he was
not at Sherborne, in going through the round of his
duties. All the month of July he spent in Jersey,
'walking in the wilderness,' as he says, hearing from no
one, and troubled in mind by vague rumours, blown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
over to him from Normandy, of the disgrace of the Duc
de Biron. He is also 'much pestered with the coming
of many Norman gentlemen, but cannot prevent it.'
On August 9, he left Jersey, in his ship the 'Antelope,'
fearing if he stayed any longer to exhaust her English
stores, and get no more 'in this poor island.' On landing
at Weymouth on the 12th, he wrote inviting Cecil
and Northumberland to meet him at Bath. He was
justly exasperated to find that during his absence
Lord Howard of Bindon had once more taken up the
wicked steward, Meeres, and persuaded Sir William
Peryam, the Chief Baron of the Exchequer, to try the
suit again. Raleigh complains to Cecil:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I never busied myself with the Lord Viscount's [Lord
Bindon's] wealth, nor of his extortions, nor poisoning of his
wife, as is here avowed, have I spoken. I have foreborne
... but I will not endure wrong at so peevish a fool's
hands any longer. I will rather lose my life, and I think
that my Lord Puritan Peryam doth think that the Queen
shall have more use of rogues and villains than of men, or
else he would not, at Bindon's instances, have yielded to
try actions against me being out of the land.</p></div>

<p>The vexation was a real one, but this is the language
of a petulant invalid, of a man to whom the grasshopper
has become a burden. We are therefore not surprised
to find him at Bath on September 15, so ill that he
can barely write a note to Cecil warning him of the
approach of a Spanish fleet, the news of which has just
reached him from Jersey. He grew little better at
Bath, and in October we find him again at Sherborne,
in very low spirits, sending by Cobham to the Queen
a stone which Bartholomew Gilbert had brought from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
America, and which Raleigh took to be a diamond.
Immediately after this, he set out on what he calls his
'miserable journey into Cornwall,' no other than his
customary autumn circuit through the Stannary Courts.
Once he had enjoyed these bracing rides over the moors,
but his animal spirits were subdued, and the cold
mosses, the streams to be forded, the dripping October
woods, and the chilly granite judgment-seat itself, had
lost their attraction for his aching joints. In November,
however, he is back at Sherborne, restored to health,
and intending to linger in Dorsetshire as long as he can,
'except there be cause to hasten me up.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had paid a brief visit to London, and
had spoken with the Queen, as it would appear, for
the last time. Cecil, who was also present, has recorded
in a letter of November 4 this interview, which took
place the previous day. On this last occasion Elizabeth
sought Raleigh's advice on her Irish policy. The President
of Munster had reported that he had seen fit to
'kill and hang divers poor men, women, and children
appertaining' to Cormac MacDermod McCarthy, Lord
of Muskerry, and to burn all his castles and villages
from Carrigrohan to Inchigeelagh. Cecil was inclined to
think that severity had been pushed too far, and that the
wretched Cormac might be left in peace. But Elizabeth
had long been accustomed to turn to Raleigh for advice
on her Irish policy. He gave, as usual, his unflinching
constant counsel for drastic severity. He 'very earnestly
moved her Majesty of all others to reject Cormac MacDermod,
first, because his country was worth her keeping,
secondly, because he lived so under the eye of the
State that, whensoever she would, it was in her power to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
suppress him.' This last, one would think, might have
been an argument for mercy. The Queen instructed
Cecil to tell Sir George Carew, that whatever pardon
was extended to others, none might be shown to Cormac.</p>

<p>It was in the same spirit of rigour that Raleigh had
for two years past advised the retention of the gentle
and learned Florence MacCarthy in the Tower, as 'a man
reconciled to the Pope, dangerous to the present State,
beloved of such as seek the ruin of the realm;' and
this at the very time when MacCarthy, trusting in his
twenty years' acquaintance with Raleigh, was praying
Cecil to let him be his judge. Raleigh little thought
that the doors which detained Florence MacCarthy would
soon open for a moment to inclose himself, and that in
two neighbouring cells through long years of captivity
the <i>History of the World</i> would grow beside the growing
<i>History of the Early Ages of Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>In this year, 1602, Raleigh parted with his vast
Irish estates to Richard Boyle, afterwards Earl of Cork,
and placed the purchase-money in privateering enterprises.
It is known that Cecil had an interest in this
fleet of merchantmen, and as late as January 1603 he
writes about a cruiser in which Raleigh and he were
partners, begging Raleigh, from prudential reasons, to
conceal the fact that Cecil was in the adventure. There
was no abatement whatever in the friendliness of Cecil's
tone to Raleigh, although in his own crafty mind he had
decided that the death of the Queen should set the term
to Raleigh's prosperity. On March 30, 1603, Elizabeth
died, and with her last breath the fortune and even the
personal safety of Raleigh expired.</p>

<p>We may pause here a moment to consider what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Raleigh's condition and fame at this critical point in his
life. He was over fifty years of age, but in health and
spirits much older than his time of life suggested; his
energy had shown signs of abatement, and for five years
he had done nothing that had drawn public attention
strongly to his gifts. If he had died in 1603, unattainted,
in peace at Sherborne, it is a question whether he would
have attracted the notice of posterity in any very general
degree. To close students of the reign of Elizabeth he
would still be, as Mr. Gardiner says, 'the man who had
more genius than all the Privy Council put together.'
But he would not be to us all the embodiment of the
spirit of England in the great age of Elizabeth, the foremost
man of his time, the figure which takes the same
place in the field of action which Shakespeare takes in
that of imagination and Bacon in that of thought. For
this something more was needed, the long torture of
imprisonment, the final crown of judicial martyrdom.
The slow tragedy closing on Tower Hill is the necessary
complement to his greatness.</p>

<p>All this it is easy to see, but it is more difficult to
understand what circumstances brought about a condition
of things in which such a tragedy became possible. We
must realise that Raleigh was a man of severe speech
and reserved manner, not easily moved to be gracious,
constantly reproving the sluggish by his rapidity, and
galling the dull by his wit. All through his career we
find him hard to get on with, proud to his inferiors,
still more crabbed to those above him. If policy required
that he should use the arts of a diplomatist, he overplayed
his part, and stung his rivals to the quick by an
obsequiousness in speech to which his eyes and shoulders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
gave the lie. With all his wealth and influence, he
missed the crowning points of his ambition; he never
sat in the House of Peers, he never pushed his way to
the council board, he never held quite the highest rank
in any naval expedition, he never ruled with only the
Queen above him even in Ireland. He who of all men
hated most and deserved least to be an underling, was
forced to play the subordinate all through the most
brilliant part of his variegated life of adventure. It was
only for a moment, at Cadiz or Fayal, that by a doubtful
breach of prerogative he struggled to the surface, to sink
again directly the achievement was accomplished. This
soured and would probably have paralysed him, but for
the noble stimulant of misfortune; and to the temper
which this continued disappointment produced, we must
look for the cause of his unpopularity.</p>

<p>It is difficult, as we have said, to understand how it
was that he had the opportunity to become unpopular.
From one of his latest letters in Elizabeth's reign we
gather that the tavern-keepers throughout the country
considered Raleigh at fault for a tax which was really
insisted on by the Queen's rapacity. He prays Cecil to
induce Elizabeth to remit it, for, he says, 'I cannot live,
nor show my face out of my doors, without it, nor dare
ride through the towns where these taverners dwell.'
This is the only passage which I can find in his published
correspondence which accounts in any degree for the
fact that we presently find Raleigh beyond question the
best-hated man in England.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3>THE TRIAL AT WINCHESTER.</h3>


<p>Raleigh was in the west when the Queen died, and he
had no opportunity of making the rush for the north
which emptied London of its nobility in the beginning
of April. King James had reached Burghley before
Raleigh, in company with his old comrade Sir Robert
Crosse, met him on his southward journey. It was
necessary that he should ask the new monarch for a
continuation of his appointments in Devon and Cornwall;
his posts at Court he had probably made up his mind
to lose. One of the blank forms which the King had
sent up to be signed by Cecil, nominally excusing the
recipient from coming to meet James, had been sent to
Raleigh, and this was of evil omen. The King received
him ungraciously, and Raleigh did not make the situation
better by explaining the cause of his disobedience.
James, it is said, admitted in a blunt pun that he had
been prejudiced against the late Queen's favourite; 'on
my soul, man,' he said, 'I have heard but <i>rawly</i> of thee.'
Raleigh was promised letters of continuance for the
Stannaries, but was warned to take no measures with
regard to the woods and parks of the Duchy of Cornwall
until further orders. After the first rough greeting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
James was fairly civil, but on April 25 privately desired
Sir Thomas Lake to settle Raleigh's business speedily,
and send him off.</p>

<p>In the first week of May, Sir Walter Raleigh was
informed by the Council that the King had chosen Sir
Thomas Erskine to be Captain of the Guard. It was
the most natural thing in the world that James should
select an old friend and a Scotchman for this confidential
post, and Raleigh, as the Council Book records, 'in a very
humble manner did submit himself.' To show that no
injury to his fortunes was intended, the King was pleased
to remit the tax of 300<i>l.</i> a year which Elizabeth had
charged on Raleigh's salary as Governor of Jersey.
There does not seem to be any evidence that Raleigh
was led into any imprudent action by all these changes.
Mr. Gardiner appears to put some faith in a despatch of
Beaumont's to Villeroi, on May 2, according to which
Raleigh was in such a rage at the loss of one of his
offices, that he rushed into the King's presence, and
poured out accusations of treason against Cecil. I cannot
but disbelieve this story; the evidence all goes to
prove that he still regarded Cecil, among the crowd of
his enemies, as at least half his friend. On May 13,
Cecil was raised to the peerage, as a sign of royal favour.</p>

<p>Lady Raleigh had always regretted the carelessness
with which her husband expended money upon Durham
House, his town mansion, without ever securing a proper
lease of it. Her prognostications of evil were soon fulfilled.
James I. was hardly safe on his throne before
the Bishop of Durham demanded the restitution of
the ancient town palace of his see. On May 31, 1603, a
royal warrant announced that Durham House was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
be restored to the Bishop&mdash;'the said dwellers in it
having no right to the same'&mdash;and Sir Walter Raleigh
was warned to give quiet possession of the house to
such as the Bishop might appoint. Raleigh, much incommoded
at so sudden notice to quit, begged to be
allowed to stay until Michaelmas. The Bishop considered
this very unreasonable, and would grant him no
later date than June 23. In this dilemma Raleigh
appealed to the Lords Commissioners, saying that he
had spent 2,000<i>l.</i> on the house, and that 'the poorest
artificer in London hath a quarter's warning given him
by his landlord.' It is interesting to us, as giving us a
notion of Raleigh's customary retinue, that he says he
has already laid in provision for his London household
of forty persons and nearly twenty horses. 'Now to
cast out my hay and oats into the streets at an hour's
warning,' for the Bishop wanted to occupy the stables
at once, 'and to remove my family and stuff in fourteen
days after, is such a severe expulsion as hath not been
offered to any man before this day.' What became of
his chattels, and what lodging he found for his family,
is uncertain; he gained no civility by his appeal. That
he was disturbed by the Bishop, and busily engaged in
changing houses all through June, is not unimportant
in connection with the accusation, at the trial, that he
had spent so much of this month plotting with Cobham
and Aremberg at Durham House.</p>

<p>It was plain that he was not judicious in his
behaviour to James. At all times he had been an advocate
of war rather than peace, even when peace was
obviously needful. Spain, too, was written upon his
heart, as Calais had been on Mary's, and even at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
untoward juncture he must needs thrust his enmity
on unwilling ears. It is hardly conceivable that he
should not know that James was deeply involved with
promises to the Catholics; and though the King had
said, in the face of his welcome to England, that he
should not need them now, he had no intention of exasperating
them. As to Spain, the King was simply
waiting for overtures from Madrid. Raleigh, who was
never a politician, saw nothing of all this, and merely
used every opportunity he had of gaining the King's
ear to urge his distasteful projects of a war. On the
last occasion when, so far as we know, Raleigh had an
interview with James, they were both the guests of
Raleigh's uncle, Sir Nicholas Carew, at Bedingfield
Park. It would seem that he had already placed in
the royal hands the manuscript of his <i>Discourse touching
War with Spain, and of the Protecting of the Netherlands</i>,
and he offered to raise two thousand men at
his own expense, and to lead them in person against
Spain. James I. must have found this persistence, especially
from a man against whom he had formed a
prejudice, exceedingly galling. No doubt, too, long
familiarity with Queen Elizabeth in the decline of her
powers, had given Raleigh a manner in approaching
royalty which was not to James's liking.</p>

<p>In July the King's Catholic troubles reached a head.
Watson's plot, involving Copley and the young Lord
Grey de Wilton, occupied the Privy Council during that
month, and it was discovered that George Brooke, a
younger brother of Lord Cobham's, was concerned in it.
The Brookes, it will be remembered, were the brothers-in-law
of Cecil himself, but by this time completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
estranged from him. It is more interesting to us to
note that Cobham himself was the only intimate friend
left to Raleigh. With extraordinary rapidity Raleigh
himself was drawn into the net of Watson's misdoings.
Copley was arrested on the 6th, and first examined on
July 12. He incriminated George Brooke, who was
arrested on the 14th. Cobham, who was busy on his
duties as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, was brought
up for examination on the 15th or 16th; and on the
17th,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Sir Walter Raleigh, who, it is said, had given
information regarding Cobham, was himself arrested at
Windsor.</p>

<p>Raleigh was walking to and fro on the great terrace
at Windsor on the morning of July 17, 1603, waiting
to ride with the King, when Cecil came to him
and requested his presence in the Council Chamber.
What happened there is unknown, but it is plain amid
the chaos of conflicting testimony that Cecil argued that
what George Brooke knew Cobham must know, and
that Raleigh was privy to all Cobham's designs. What
form the accusation finally took, we shall presently see.
When it was over Raleigh wrote a letter to the Council,
in which he made certain random statements with
regard to offers made to Cobham about June 9 by a
certain attendant of Count Aremberg, the ambassador
of the Archduke Albert. From the windows of Durham
House he had seen, he said, Cobham's boat cross over to
the Austrian's lodgings in St. Saviour's. He probably
felt himself forced to state this from finding that the
Council already knew something of Cobham's relations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
with Aremberg. Still, in the light of later events, the
writing of this letter may seem to us a grave mistake.
It was instantly shown, on the very next day, to Cobham,
and doctored in such a way as to make the latter suppose
that Raleigh had gratuitously betrayed him.</p>

<p>On the day that Raleigh was arrested, July 17,
George Brooke said in examination that 'the conspirators
among themselves thought Sir Walter Raleigh a fit man
to be of the action.' This did not amount to much, but
Brooke soon became more copious and protested a fuller
tale day by day. Nothing, however, that could touch
Raleigh was obtained from any witness until, on the
20th, Lord Cobham, who had been thoroughly frightened
by daily cross-examination, was shown the letter, or part
of the letter, from Raleigh to Cecil to which reference
has just been made. He then broke out with, 'O
traitor! O villain! now will I tell you all the truth!'
and proceeded at once to say that 'he had never entered
into those courses but by Raleigh's instigation, and that
he would never let him alone!' This accusation he
entirely retracted nine days later, in consequence of
some expostulation from Raleigh which had found its
way from one prisoner to the other, for Raleigh was by
this time safe in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>It is most probable that he was taken thither on
July 18, immediately after his arrest. On the 20th,
after Cobham's formal accusation, he was evidently
more strictly confined, and it must have been immediately
after receiving news of this charge that he
attempted to commit suicide. He would be told of
Cobham's words, in all likelihood, on the morning of
the 21st; he would write the letter to his wife after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
meditating on the results of his position, and then
would follow the scene that Cecil describes in a letter
dated fifteen days later:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Although lodged and attended as well as in his own house,
yet one afternoon, while divers of us were in the Tower,
examining these prisoners, Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to
have murdered himself. Whereof when we were advertised,
we came to him, and found him in some agony, seeming to
be unable to endure his misfortunes, and protesting
innocency, with carelessness of life. In that way, he had
wounded himself under the right pap, but no way mortally.</p></div>

<p>There is no reason whatever for supposing that this
was not a genuine attempt at suicide. We can have
no difficulty in entering into the mood of Raleigh's
mind. Roused to fresh energy by misfortune, his brain
and will had of late once more become active, and he
was planning adventures by land and sea. If James
did oust him from his posts about the Court in favour
of leal Scotchmen, Raleigh would brace himself by some
fresh expedition against Cadiz, some new settlement of
Virginia or Guiana. In the midst of such schemes, the
blow of his unexpected arrest would come upon him out
of the blue. He could bear poverty, neglect, hardships,
even death itself; but imprisonment, with a disgraceful
execution as the only end of it, that he was not at first
prepared to endure. He had tasted captivity in the
Tower once before; he knew the intolerable tedium
and fret of it; and the very prospect maddened him.
Nor would his thoughts be only or mainly of himself.
He would reflect that if he were once condemned,
nothing but financial ruin and social obloquy would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
attend his wife and children; and this it was which
inspired the passionate and pathetic letter which he
addressed to Lady Raleigh just before he stabbed himself.
This letter seems to close the real life of Raleigh.
He was to breathe, indeed, for fifteen years more, but
only in a sort of living death. He begins thus
distractedly:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Receive from thy unfortunate husband these his last
lines: these the last words that ever thou shalt receive from
him. That I can live never to see thee and my child more!
I cannot! I have desired God and disputed with my reason,
but nature and compassion hath the victory. That I can
live to think how you are both left a spoil to my enemies,
and that my name shall be a dishonour to my child! I
cannot! I cannot endure the memory thereof. Unfortunate
woman, unfortunate child, comfort yourselves, trust God,
and be contented with your poor estate. I would have
bettered it, if I had enjoyed a few years.</p></div>

<p>He goes on to tell his wife that she is still young,
and should marry again; and then falls into a tumult of
distress over his own accusation. Presently he grows
calmer, after a wild denunciation of Cobham, and bids
his wife forgive, as he does:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Live humble, for thou hast but a time also. God forgive
my Lord Harry [Howard], for he was my heavy enemy.
And for my Lord Cecil, I thought he would never forsake
me in extremity. I would not have done it him, God
knows. But do not thou know it, for he must be master of
thy child, and may have compassion of him. Be not dismayed,
that I died in despair of God's mercies. Strive not
to dispute, but assure thyself that God has not left me,
nor Satan tempted me. Hope and despair live not together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
I know it is forbidden to destroy ourselves, but I trust it is
forbidden in this sort&mdash;that we destroy not ourselves despairing
of God's mercy.</p></div>

<p>After an impassioned prayer, he speaks of his estate.
His debts, he confesses, are many, and as the latest of
them he mentions what he owes to an expedition to
Virginia then on the return voyage, the expedition in
which Cecil had a share. Then his shame and anger
break out again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What will my poor servants think, at their return, when
they hear I am accused to be Spanish who sent them, at
my great charge, to plant and discover upon his territory!
O intolerable infamy! O God! I cannot resist these
thoughts. I cannot live to think how I am divided, to think
of the expectation of my enemies, the scorns I shall receive,
the cruel words of lawyers, the infamous taunts and despites,
to be made a wonder and a spectacle!... I commend
unto you my poor brother Adrian Gilbert. The lease of
Sandridge is his, and none of mine. Let him have it, for
God's cause. He knows what is due to me upon it. And
be good to Keymis, for he is a perfect honest man, and hath
much wrong for my sake. For the rest I commend me to
thee, and thee to God, and the Lord knows my sorrow to
part from thee and my poor child. But part I must.... I
bless my poor child; and let him know his father was
no traitor. Be bold of my innocence, for God&mdash;to whom I
offer life and soul&mdash;knows it.... And the Lord for ever
keep thee, and give thee comfort in both worlds.</p></div>

<p>There are few documents of the period more affecting
than this, but he suffered no return of this mood. The
pain of his wound and the weakness it produced quieted
him at first, and then hope began to take the place of
this agony of despair. Meanwhile his treason was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
taken for granted, and he was stripped of his appointments.
He had been forced to resign the Wardenship
of the Stannaries to Sir Francis Godolphin, and the
wine patent was given to the Earl of Nottingham, who
behaved with scant courtesy to his old friend and
comrade. Sir John Peyton, after guarding Raleigh
for ten days at the Tower, was released from the post
of Lieutenant, and was given the Governorship of Jersey,
of which Raleigh was deprived. On the next day,
August 1, Sir George Harvey took Peyton's place as
Lieutenant of the Tower, the last report from the
outgoing officer being that 'Sir Walter Raleigh's hurt
is doing very well.' It was evidently not at all severe,
for on the 4th he was pronounced cured, 'both in body
and mind.' On the 3rd, De Beaumont, the French
ambassador, had written confidentially to Henry IV.
that Raleigh gave out that this attempt at suicide 'was
formed in order that his fate might not serve as a
triumph to his enemies, whose power to put him to
death, despite his innocence, he well knows.'</p>

<p>On August 10 there had still been made no definite
accusation linking Raleigh or even Cobham with
Watson's plot. All that could be said was that Raleigh
and Cobham were intimate with the plotters, and that
they had mutually accused each other, vaguely, of
entering into certain possibly treasonable negotiations
with Austria. On that day De Beaumont was inclined
to think that both would be acquitted. It does not
seem that James was anxious to push matters to an
extremity; but the Government, instigated by Suffolk,
insisted on severity. On August 13, Raleigh was again
examined in the Tower, and this time more rigorously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
A distinct statement was now gained from him, to the
effect that Cobham had offered him 10,000 crowns to
further a peace between Spain and England; Raleigh
had answered, '"When I see the money I will make you
an answer," for I thought it one of his ordinary idle
conceits.' He insisted, however, that this conversation
had nothing to do with Aremberg. All through the
month of September the plague was raging in London.
In spite of all precautions, it found its way into the
outlying posts of the Tower. Sir George Harvey sent
away his family, and Wood, who was in special charge of
the State prisoners, abandoned them to the Lieutenant.
On September 7 we find Harvey sending Raleigh's
private letters by a man of the name of Mellersh, who
had been Cobham's steward and was now his secretary.
Raleigh and Cobham had become convinced that, whatever
was their innocence or guilt, it was absolutely
necessary that each should have some idea what the
other was confessing.</p>

<p>On September 21, Raleigh, Cobham, and George
Brooke were indicted at Staines. The indictment
shows us for the first time what the Government had
determined to accuse Raleigh of plotting. It is plainly
put that he is charged with 'exciting rebellion against
the King, and raising one Arabella Stuart to the Crown
of England.' Without going into vexed questions of
the claim of this unhappy woman, we may remind ourselves
that Arabella Stuart was James I.'s first cousin,
the daughter of Charles Stuart, fifth Earl of Lennox,
Darnley's elder brother. Her father had died in 1576,
soon after her birth. About 1588 she had come up to
London to be presented to Elizabeth, and on that occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
had amused Raleigh with her gay accomplishments.
The legal quibble on which her claim was founded was
the fact that she was born in England, whereas James
as a Scotchman was supposed to be excluded. Arabella
was no pretender; her descent from Margaret, the sister
of Henry VIII., was complete, and if James had died
childless and she had survived him, it is difficult to see
how her claim could have been avoided in favour of the
Suffolk line. Meantime she had no real claim, and no
party in the country. But Elizabeth, in one of her
fantastic moods, had presented Arabella to the wife of a
French ambassador, as 'she that will sometime be Lady
Mistress here, even as I am.' Before the Queen's death
Arabella's very name had become hateful to her, but this
was the slender ground upon which Cobham's, but
scarcely Raleigh's, hopes were based.</p>

<p>The jury was well packed with adverse names.
The precept is signed by Raleigh's old and bitter
enemy, Lord Howard of Bindon, now Earl of Suffolk.
The trial, probably on account of the terror caused by
the ravages of the plague, was adjourned for nearly two
months, which Raleigh spent in the Tower. Almost
the only remnant of all his great wealth which was not
by this time forfeited, was his cluster of estates at Sherborne.
He attempted to tie these up to his son, and his
brother, Adrian Gilbert, and Cecil appears to have been
a friend to Lady Raleigh in this matter. It was so
generally taken for granted that Raleigh would be condemned,
that no mock modesty prevented the King's
Scotch favourites from asking for his estates. In October
Cecil informed Sir James Elphinstone that he was at
least the twelfth person who had already applied for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
gift of Sherborne. Fortunately Raleigh, as late as the
summer of 1602, had desired the judge, Sir John Doddridge,
to draw up a conveyance of Sherborne to his son,
and then to his brother, with a rent-charge of 200<i>l.</i> a
year for life to Lady Raleigh. For the present Cecil
firmly refused to allow anyone to tamper with this
conveyance, and Sherborne was the raft upon which the
Raleighs sailed through the worst tempest of the trial.
Cecil undoubtedly retained a certain tenderness towards
his old friend Lady Raleigh, and for her sake, rather than
her husband's, he extended a sort of protection to them
in their misfortune. She appealed to him in touching
language to 'pity the name of your ancient friend on his
poor little creature, which may live to honour you, that
we may all lift up our hands and hearts in prayer for
you and yours. If you truly knew, you would pity your
poor unfortunate friend, which relieth wholly on your
honourable and wonted favour.' Cecil listened, and
almost relented.</p>

<p>At first Cobham was not confined in the Tower, and
before he came there Raleigh was advised by some of
his friends to try to communicate with him. According
to Raleigh's account, he wrote first of all, 'You or I
must go to trial. If I first, then your accusation is the
only evidence against me.' Cobham's reply was not
satisfactory, and Raleigh wrote again, and Cobham
then sent what Raleigh thought 'a very good letter.'
The person who undertook to carry on this secret correspondence
was no other than young Sir John Peyton,
whom James had just knighted, the son of the late
Lieutenant of the Tower. Sir George Harvey seems
to have suspected, without wishing to be disagreeable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
for Raleigh had to hint to Cobham that the Lieutenant
might be blamed if it were discovered that letters were
passing. Cobham shifted from hour to hour, and
changed colour like a moral chameleon; Raleigh could
not depend on him, nor even influence him. Meanwhile
Cobham was transferred to the Tower, and now
communication between the prisoners seemed almost
impossible. However, the servant who was waiting
upon Raleigh, a man named Cotterell, undertook to
speak to Cobham, and desired him to leave his window
in the Wardrobe Tower ajar on a certain night.
Raleigh had prepared a letter, entreating Cobham to
clear him at all costs. This letter Cotterell tied round
an apple, and at eight o'clock at night threw it dexterously
into Cobham's room; half an hour afterwards a
second letter, of still more complete retractation, was
pushed by Cobham under his door. This Raleigh hid
in his pocket and showed to no one.</p>

<p>Thus October passed, and during these ten weeks
the popular fury against the accused had arisen to a
tumultuous pitch. On November 5, Sir W. Waad was
instructed to bring Raleigh out of the Tower, and
prepare him for his trial. As has been said, the plague
was in London, and the prisoner was therefore taken
down to Winchester, to be tried in Wolvesey Castle.
So terrible was the popular hatred of Raleigh, that the
conveyance of him was attended with difficulty, and
had to be constantly delayed. 'It was hob or nob
whether he should have been brought alive through such
multitudes of unruly people as did exclaim against him;'
and to escape Lynch law a whole week had to be given
to the transit. 'The fury and tumult of the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was so great' that Waad had to set watches, and hasten
his prisoner by a stage at a time, when the mob was
not expecting him. The wretched people seemed to
forget all about the plague for the moment, so eager
were they to tear Raleigh to pieces. When he had
reached Winchester, it was thought well to wait five
days more, to give the popular fury time to quiet down
a little. A Court of King's Bench was fitted up in the
castle, an old Episcopal palace, not well suited for that
purpose.</p>

<p>On Thursday, November 17, 1603, Raleigh's trial
began. In the centre of the upper part of the court,
under a canopy of brocade, sat the Lord Chief Justice
of England, Popham, and on either side of him, as
special commissioners, Cecil, Waad, the Earls of Suffolk
and Devonshire, with the judges, Anderson, Gawdy, and
Warburton, and other persons of distinction. Opposite
Popham sat the Attorney-General, Sir Edward Coke,
who conducted the trial. It was actually opened, however,
by Hale, the Serjeant, who attempted, as soon as
Raleigh had pleaded 'not guilty' to the indictment, to
raise an unseemly laugh by saying that Lady Arabella
'hath no more title to the Crown than I have, which,
before God, I utterly renounce.' Raleigh was noticed
to smile at this, and we can imagine that his irony
would be roused by such buffoonery on an occasion so
serious. There was no more jesting of this kind, but
the whole trial has remained a type of what was uncouth
and undesirable in the conduct of criminal trials through
the beginning of the seventeenth century. The nation so
rapidly increased in sensitiveness and in a perception
of legal decency, that one of the very judges who con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>ducted
Raleigh's trial, Gawdy, lived to look back upon
it with horror, and to say, when he himself lay upon
his death-bed, that such a mode of procedure 'injured
and degraded the justice of England.'</p>

<p>When Hale had ceased his fooling, Coke began in
earnest. He was a man a little older than Raleigh, and
of a conceited and violent nature, owing not a little of
his exaggerated reputation to the dread that he inspired.
He was never more rude and brutal than in his treatment
of Sir Walter Raleigh upon this famous occasion,
and even in a court packed with enemies, in which the
proud poet and navigator might glance round without
meeting one look more friendly than that in the cold
eyes of Cecil, the needless insolence of Coke went too
far, and caused a revulsion in Raleigh's favour. Coke
began by praising the clemency of the King, who had
forbidden the use of torture, and proceeded to charge
Sir Walter Raleigh with what he called 'treason of the
Main,' to distinguish it from that of George Brooke and
his fellows, which was 'of the Bye.' He described this
latter, and tried to point out that the former was closely
cognate to it. In order to mask the difficulty, nay, the
impossibility, of doing this successfully on the evidence
which he possessed, he wandered off into a long and
wordy disquisition on treasonable plots in general,
ending abruptly with that of Edmund de la Pole. Then,
for the first time, Coke faced the chief difficulty
of the Government, namely, that there was but one
witness against Raleigh. He did not allow, as indeed
he could not be expected to do, that Cobham had
shifted like a Reuben, and was now adhering, for the
moment, to an eighth several confession of what he and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Raleigh had actually done or meant to do. It was
enough for Coke to insist that Cobham's evidence, that
is to say, whichever of the eight conflicting statements
suited the prosecution best, was as valuable, in a case
of this kind, as 'the inquest of twelve men.'</p>

<p>Having thus, as he thought, shut Raleigh's mouth
with regard to this one great difficulty, he continued to
declaim against 'those traitors,' obstinately persisting
in mixing up Raleigh's 'Main' with the 'Bye,' in spite
of the distinction which he himself had drawn. Raleigh
appealed against this once or twice, and at last showed
signs of impatience. Coke then suddenly turned upon
him, and cried out, 'To whom, Sir Walter, did you
bear malice? To the royal children?' In the altercation
that followed, Coke lost his temper in earnest, and
allowed himself to call Raleigh 'a monster with an
English face, but a Spanish heart.' He then proceeded
to state what the accusation of Sir Walter really
amounted to, and in the midst of the inexplicable chaos
of this whole affair it may be well to stand for a moment
on this scrap of solid ground. Coke's words were:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You would have stirred England and Scotland both.
You incited the Lord Cobham, as soon as Count Aremberg
came into England, to go to him. The night he went, you supped
with the Lord Cobham, and he brought you after supper
to Durham House; and then the same night by a back-way
went with La Renzi to Count Aremberg, and got from him
a promise for the money. After this it was arranged that
the Lord Cobham should go to Spain and return by Jersey,
where you were to meet him about the distribution of the
money; because Cobham had not so much policy or wickedness
as you. Your intent was to set up the Lady Arabella as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a titular Queen, and to depose our present rightful King,
the lineal descendant of Edward IV. You pretend that
this money was to forward the Peace with Spain. Your
jargon was 'peace,' which meant Spanish invasion and
Scottish subversion.</p></div>

<p>This was plain language, at least; this was the case
for the prosecution, stripped of all pedantic juggling;
and Raleigh now drew himself together to confute these
charges as best he might. 'Let me answer,' he said;
'it concerns my life;' and from this point onwards, as
Mr. Edwards remarks, the trial becomes a long and impassioned
dialogue. Coke refused to let Raleigh speak,
and in this was supported by Popham, a very old man,
who owed his position in that court more to his age
than his talents, and who was solicitous to be on friendly
terms with the Attorney. Coke then proceeded to
argue that Raleigh's relations with Cobham had been
notoriously so intimate that there was nothing surprising
or improbable in the accusation that he shared his
guilt. He then nimbly went on to expatiate with
regard to the circumstances of Cobham's treason, and
was deft enough to bring these forward in such a way
as to leave on the mind of his hearers the impression
that these were things proved against Raleigh. To
this practice, which deserved the very phrases which
Coke used against the prisoner's dealings, 'devilish and
machiavelian policy,' Raleigh protested again and again
that he ought not to be subjected, until Coke lost his
temper once more, and cried, 'I <i>thou</i> thee, thou traitor,
and I will prove thee the rankest traitor in all England.'
A sort of hubbub now ensued, and the Lord Chief Justice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
again interfered to silence Raleigh, with a poor show of
impartiality.</p>

<p>Coke, however, had well nigh exhausted the slender
stock of evidence with which he had started. For a
few minutes longer he tried by sheer bluster to conceal
the poverty of the case, and last of all he handed one of
Cobham's confessions to the Clerk of the Crown to be
read in court. It entered into no particulars, which
Cobham said their lordships must not expect from him,
for he was so confounded that he had lost his memory,
but it vaguely asserted that he would never have entered
into 'these courses' but for Raleigh's instigation. The
reading being over, Coke at last sat down. Raleigh
began to address the jury, very quietly at first. He
pointed out that this solitary accusation, by the most
wavering of mortals, uttered in a moment of anger, was
absolutely all the evidence that could be brought against
him. He admitted that he suspected Cobham of secret
communications with Count Aremberg, but he declared
that he knew no details, and that whatever he discovered,
Cecil also was privy to. He had hitherto spoken softly;
he now suddenly raised his voice, and electrified the
court by turning upon Sir Edward Coke, and pouring
forth the eloquent and indignant protest which must
now be given in his own words.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Master Attorney, whether to favour or to disable my
Lord Cobham you speak as you will of him, yet he is not
such a babe as you make him. He hath dispositions of such
violence, which his best friends could never temper. But it
is very strange that I, at this time, should be thought to
plot with the Lord Cobham, knowing him a man that hath
neither love nor following; and, myself, at this time having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
resigned a place of my best command in an office I had in
Cornwall. I was not so bare of sense but I saw that, if
ever this State was strong, it was now that we have the
Kingdom of Scotland united, whence we were wont to fear
all our troubles&mdash;Ireland quieted, where our forces were
wont to be divided&mdash;Denmark assured, whom before we
were always wont to have in jealousy&mdash;the Low Countries
our nearest neighbour. And, instead of a Lady whom time
had surprised, we had now an active King, who would be
present at his own businesses. For me, at this time, to
make myself a Robin Hood, a Wat Tyler [in the inadvertence
of the moment he seems to have said 'a Tom
Tailor,' by mistake], a Kett, or a Jack Cade! I was not so
mad! I knew the state of Spain well, his weakness, his
poorness, his humbleness at this time. I knew that six
times we had repulsed his forces&mdash;thrice in Ireland, thrice
at sea, once upon our coast and twice upon his own.
Thrice had I served against him myself at sea&mdash;wherein,
for my country's sake, I had expended of my own property
forty thousand marks. I knew that where beforetime he
was wont to have forty great sails, at the least, in his ports,
now he hath not past six or seven. And for sending to his
Indies, he was driven to have strange vessels, a thing
contrary to the institutions of his ancestors, who straitly
forbade that, even in case of necessity, they should make
their necessity known to strangers. I knew that of twenty-five
millions which he had from the Indies, he had scarce
any left. Nay, I knew his poorness to be such at this time
that the Jesuits, his imps, begged at his church doors; his
pride so abated that, notwithstanding his former high terms,
he was become glad to congratulate his Majesty, and to
send creeping unto him for peace.</p></div>

<p>In these fiery words the audience was reminded of
the consistent hatred which Raleigh had always shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to Spain, and of the services which he himself, now a
prisoner at the bar, had performed for the liberties of
England. The sympathies of the spectators began to
be moved; those who had execrated Raleigh most felt
that they had been deceived, and that so noble an
Englishman, however indiscreet he might have been,
could not by any possibility have intrigued with the
worst enemies of England.</p>

<p>But the prisoner had more to do than to rouse the irresponsible
part of his audience by his patriotic eloquence.
The countenances of his judges remained as cold to him
as ever, and he turned to the serious business of his
defence. His quick intelligence saw that the telling
point in Coke's diatribe had been the emphasis he had
laid on Raleigh's intimate friendship with Cobham.
He began to try and explain away this intimacy, stating
what we now know was not exactly true, namely that his
'privateness' with Cobham only concerned business, in
which the latter sought to make use of his experience.
He dwelt on Cobham's wealth, and argued that so rich
a man would not venture to conspire. All this part of
the defence seems to me injudicious. Raleigh was on
safer ground in making another sudden appeal to the
sentiment of the court: 'As for my knowing that he had
conspired all these things against Spain, for Arabella,
and against the King, I protest before Almighty God I
am as clear as whosoever here is freest.'</p>

<p>After a futile discussion as to the value of Cobham's
evidence, the foreman of the jury asked a plain question:
'I desire to understand the time of Sir Walter Raleigh's
first letter, and of the Lord Cobham's accusation.'
Upon this Cecil spoke for the first time, spinning out a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
long and completely unintelligible sentence which was
to serve the foreman as an answer. Before the jury
could recover from their bewilderment, this extraordinary
trial, which proceeded like an Adventure in Wonderland,
was begun once more by Coke, who started afresh
with voluble denunciation of the defendant, for whom,
he said, it would have been better 'to have stayed in
Guiana than to be so well acquainted with the state of
Spain.' Coke was still pouring out a torrent of mere
abuse, when Raleigh suddenly interrupted him, and
addressing the judges, claimed that Cobham should then
and there be brought face to face with him. Since he
had been in the Tower he had been studying the law,
and he brought forward statutes of Edwards III. and IV.
to support his contention that he could not be convicted
on Cobham's bare accusation. The long speech he
made at this point was a masterpiece of persuasive
eloquence, and it is worth noting that Dudley Carleton,
who was in court, wrote to a friend that though when
the trial began he would have gone a hundred miles
to see Raleigh hanged, when it had reached this stage
he would have gone a thousand to save his life.</p>

<p>The judges, however, and Popham in particular,
were not so moved, and Raleigh's objection to the evidence
of Cobham was overruled. Coke was so far influenced
by it that he now attempted to show that there
was other proof against the prisoner, and tried, very
awkwardly, to make the confessions of Watson and
George Brooke in the 'Bye' tell against Raleigh in the
'Main.' Raleigh's unlucky statement, made at Windsor,
to the effect that Cobham had offered him 10,000 crowns,
and an examination in which Raleigh's friend Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Keymis admitted a private interview between Cobham
and Raleigh during Count Aremberg's stay in London,
were then read. In the discussion on these documents
the court and the prisoner fell to actual wrangling; in
the buzz of voices it was hard to tell what was said, until
a certain impression was at last made by Coke, who
screamed out that Raleigh 'had a Spanish heart and
was a spider of hell.' This produced a lull, and thereupon
followed an irrelevant dispute as to whether or no
Raleigh had once had in his possession a book containing
treasonable allusions to the claims of the King of
Scotland. Raleigh admitted the possession of this volume,
and said that Cecil gave him leave to take it out of Lord
Burghley's library. He added that no book was published
towards the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign that
did not pass through his hands. It would be interesting
to know whether he meant that he exercised a
private censorship of the press, or that he bought everything
that appeared. At all events, the point was
allowed to drop.</p>

<p>Raleigh now gave his attention to the evidence
which Keymis had given under threat of the rack.
That this torture had been threatened, in express
disobedience to the King's order, staggered some of the
commissioners, and covered Sir William Waad with
confusion. The eliciting of this fact seems to have
brought over to Raleigh's side the most valuable and
unexpected help, for, in the discussion that ensued, Cecil
suddenly pleaded that Raleigh should be allowed fair
play. The Attorney then brought forward the case of
Arabella Stuart, and a fresh sensation was presented
to the audience, who, after listening to Cecil, were sud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>denly
thrilled to hear a voice at the back of the court
shout, 'The Lady doth here protest, upon her salvation,
that she never dealt in any of these things.' It was the
voice of the Earl of Nottingham, who had entered unperceived,
and who was standing there with Arabella
Stuart on his arm. Their apparition was no surprise to
the judges; it had been carefully prearranged.</p>

<p>The trial dragged on with irrelevant production of
evidence by Coke, occasional bullying by the Lord
Chief Justice, and repeated appeals for fairness from
Cecil, who cautiously said that 'but for his fault,' he
was still Raleigh's friend. Posterity has laughed at
one piece of the Attorney's evidence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is one Dyer, a pilot, that being in Lisbon met
with a Portugal gentleman, which asked him if the King
of England was crowned yet. To whom he answered, 'I
think not yet, but he shall be shortly.' 'Nay,' said the
Portugal, 'that shall he never be, for his throat will be
cut by Don Raleigh and Don Cobham before he be
crowned.'</p></div>

<p>A prosecution that calls for evidence such as this has
simply broken down. The whole report of the trial is so
puerile, that it can only be understood by bearing in
mind that, as Mr. Gardiner says, the Government were
in possession of a good deal of evidence which they
could not produce in court. The King wished to spare
Arabella, and to accept Aremberg's protestations with
the courtesy due to an ambassador. It was therefore
impossible to bring forward a letter which Cecil possessed
from Cobham to Arabella, and two from Aremberg
to Cobham. The difficulty was not to prove Cobham's
guilt, however, but to connect Raleigh closely enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
with Cobham, and this Coke went on labouring to do.
At last he laid a trap for Raleigh. He induced him to
argue on the subject, and then Coke triumphantly drew
from his pocket a long letter Cobham had written to
the commissioners the day before, a letter in which
Cobham disclosed all the secret correspondence Raleigh
had had with him since his imprisonment, and even the
picturesque story of the letter that was bound round the
apple and thrown into Cobham's window in the Tower.</p>

<p>At the production of this document, Sir Walter
Raleigh fairly lost his self-possession. He had no idea
that any of these facts were in the hands of the Government.
His bewilderment and dejection soon, however,
left him sufficiently for him to recollect the other letter
of Cobham's which he possessed. He drew it from his
pocket, and, Cobham's writing being very bad, he could
not, from his agitation, read it; Coke desired that it
should not be produced, but Cecil interposed once
more, and volunteered to read it aloud. This letter
was Raleigh's last effort. He said, when Cecil had
finished, 'Now, my masters, you have heard both. That
showed against me is but a voluntary confession. This
is under oath, and the deepest protestations a Christian
man can make. Therefore believe which of these hath
more force.' The jury then retired; and in a quarter
of an hour returned with the verdict 'Guilty.' Raleigh
had, in fact, confessed that Cobham had mentioned the
plot to him, though nothing would induce him to admit
that he had asked Cobham for a sum of money, or consented
to take any active part. Still this was enough;
and in the face of his unfortunate prevarication about
the interview with Renzi, the jury could hardly act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
otherwise. For a summing up of both sides of the
vexed question what shadow of truth there was in the
general accusation, the reader may be recommended to
Mr. Gardiner's brilliant pages.</p>

<p>Raleigh had defended himself with great courage
and intelligence, and the crowd in court were by no
means in sympathy with the brutal and violent address
in which Popham gave judgment. On the very day on
which Raleigh was condemned, there began that reaction
in his favour which has been proceeding ever
since. When the Lord Chief Justice called the noble
prisoner a traitor and an atheist, the bystanders, who
after all were Englishmen, though they had met prepared
to tear Raleigh limb from limb, could bear it no
longer, and they hissed the judge, as a little before they
had hooted Coke. To complete the strangeness of this
strange trial, when sentence had been passed, Raleigh
advanced quickly up the court, unprevented, and spoke
to Cecil and one or two other commissioners, asking, as
a favour, that the King would permit Cobham to die
first. Before he was secured by the officers, he had
found time for this last protest: 'Cobham is a false
and cowardly accuser. He can face neither me nor
death without acknowledging his falsehood.' He was
then led away to gaol.</p>

<p>For a month Raleigh was retained at Winchester.
He found a friend, almost the only one who dared to
speak for him, in Lady Pembroke, the saintly sister of
Sir Philip Sidney, who showed <i>veteris vestigia flamm&aelig;</i>,
the embers of the old love Raleigh had met with from
her brother's family, and sent her son, Lord Pembroke,
to the King. She did little good, and Raleigh did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
still less by a letter he now wrote to James, the first
personal appeal he had made to his Majesty. It was a
humble entreaty for life, begging the King to listen to
the charitable advice which the English law, 'knowing
her own cruelty, doth give to her superior,' to be
pitiful more than just. This letter has been thought
obsequious and unmanly; but it abates no jot of the
author's asseverations that he was innocent of all offence,
and, surely, in the very face of death a man may be excused
for writing humbly to a despot. Lady Raleigh,
meanwhile, was clinging about the knees of Cecil, whose
demeanour during the trial had given her fresh hopes.
But neither the King nor Cecil gave any sign, and in the
gathering reaction in favour of Raleigh remained apparently
firm for punishment. The whole body of the
accused were by this time convicted, Watson and all
his companions on the 16th, Raleigh on the 17th,
Cobham and Gray on the 18th. On the 29th Watson
and Clarke, the other priest, were executed. Next
day, the Spanish ambassador pleaded for Raleigh's life,
but was repulsed. The King desired the clergy who
attended the surviving prisoners to prepare them rigorously
for death, and the Bishop of Winchester gave
Raleigh no hope. On December 6, George Brooke was
executed. And now James seems to have thought that
enough blood had been spilt. He would find out the
truth by collecting dying confessions from culprits who,
after all, should not die.</p>

<p>The next week was occupied with the performance
of the curious burlesque which James had invented.
The day after George Brooke was beheaded, the King
drew up a warrant to the Sheriff of Hampshire for stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of all the other executions. With this document in his
bosom, he signed death-warrants for Markham, Gray,
and Cobham to be beheaded on the 10th, and Raleigh
on the 13th. The King told nobody of his intention,
except a Scotch boy, John Gibb, who was his page
at the moment. On December 10, at ten o'clock in
the morning, Sir Walter Raleigh was desired to come
to the window of his cell in Wolvesey Castle. The
night before, he had written an affecting letter of farewell
to his wife, and&mdash;such, at least, is my personal
conviction from the internal evidence&mdash;the most extraordinary
and most brilliant of his poems, <i>The Pilgrimage</i>.
By this time he was sorry that he had bemeaned
himself in his first paroxysm of despair, and he
entreated Lady Raleigh to try to get back the letters
in which he sued for his life, 'for,' he said, 'I disdain
myself for begging it.' He went on:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Know it, dear wife, that your son is the child of a true
man, and who, in his own respect, despiseth Death, and all
his misshapen and ugly forms. I cannot write much. God
knows how hardly I stole this time, when all sleep; and it
is time to separate my thoughts from the world. Beg my
dead body, which living was denied you; and either lay it
at Sherborne, if the land continue [yours], or in Exeter
Church, by my father and mother. I can write no more.
Time and Death call me away.</p></div>

<p>From his window overlooking the Castle Green,
Raleigh saw Markham, a very monument of melancholy,
led through the steady rain to the scaffold. He saw the
Sheriff presently called away, but could not see the
Scotch lad who called him, who was Gibb riding in
with the reprieve. He could see Markham standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
before the block, he could see the Sheriff return, speak
in a low voice to Markham, and lead him away into
Arthur's Hall and lock him up there. He could then
see Grey led out, he could see his face light up with a
gleam of hope, as he stealthily stirred the wet straw
with his foot and perceived there was no blood there.
He could see, though he could not hear, Grey's lips
move in the prayer in which he made his protestation of
innocence, and as he stood ready at the block, he could
see the Sheriff speak to him also, and lead him away,
and lock him up with Markham in Arthur's Hall. Then
Raleigh, wondering more and more, so violently curious
that the crowd below noticed his eager expression, could
see Cobham brought out, weeping and muttering, in a
lamentable disorder; he could see him praying, and
when the prayer was over, he could see the Sheriff
leave him to stand alone, trembling, on the scaffold,
while he went to fetch Grey and Markham from their
prison. Then he could see the trio, with an odd expression
of hope in their faces, stand side by side a moment,
to be harangued by the Sheriff, and then suddenly on
his bewildered ears rang out the plaudits of the assembled
crowd, all Winchester clapping its hands because
the King had mercifully saved the lives of the prisoners.
And still the steady rain kept falling as the Castle Green
grew empty, and Raleigh at his window was left alone with
his bewilderment. He was very soon told that he also
was spared, and on December 16, 1603, he was taken
back to the Tower of London. Such was James's curious
but not altogether inhuman sketch for a burlesque.</p>

<h3>IN THE TOWER.</h3>


<p>It is no longer possible for us to follow the personal
life of Raleigh as we have hitherto been doing, step by
step. In the deep monotony of confinement, twelve
years passed over him without leaving any marks of
months or days upon his chronicle of patience. A
hopeless prisoner ceases to take any interest in the
passage of time, and Raleigh's few letters from the
Tower are almost all of them undated. His comfort
had its vicissitudes; he was now tormented, now indulged.
A whisper from the outer world would now
give him back a gleam of hope, now a harsh answer
would complete again the darkness of his hopelessness.
He was vexed with ill-health, and yet from the age of
fifty-one to that of sixty-three the inherent vigour of his
constitution, and his invincible desire to live, were
unabated. From all his pains and sorrows he took
refuge, as so many have done before him, in the one
unfailing Nepenthe, the consolatory self-forgetfulness of
literature. It was in the Tower that the main bulk of
his voluminous writings were produced.</p>

<p>He was confined in the upper story of what was
called the Garden Tower, now the Bloody Tower, and
not, as is so often said, in the White Tower, so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
little cell with a dim arched light, the Chapel Crypt off
Queen Elizabeth's Armoury, which used to be pointed
out to visitors as the dungeon in which Raleigh wrote
<i>The History of the World</i>, never, in all probability,
heard the sound of his footsteps. It is a myth that he
was confined at all in such a dungeon as this. According
to Mr. Loftie, his apartments were those immediately
above the principal gate to the Inner Ward, and had,
besides a window looking westward out of the Tower,
an entrance to themselves at a higher level, the level
of the Lieutenant's and Constable's lodgings. They
probably opened directly into a garden which has since
been partly built over.</p>

<p>Raleigh was comfortably lodged; it was Sir William
Waad's complaint that the rooms were too spacious.
Lady Raleigh and her son shared them with him for
a considerable time, and Sir Walter was never without
three personal servants. He was poor, in comparison
with his former opulent estate, but he was never in
want. Sherborne just sufficed for six years to supply
such needs as presented themselves to a prisoner. His
personal expenses in the Tower slightly exceeded 200<i>l.</i>,
or 1,000<i>l.</i> of our money; there was left a narrow
margin for Lady Raleigh. The months of January
and February 1604 were spent in trying to make the
best terms possible for his wife and son. In a letter to
the Lords of the Council, Raleigh mentions that he has
lost 3,000<i>l.</i> (or 15,000<i>l.</i> in Victorian money) a year by
being deprived of his five main sources of income, namely
the Governorship of Jersey, the Patent of the Wine
Office, the Wardenship of the Stannaries, the Rangership
of Gillingham Forest, and the Lieutenancy of Portland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Castle. He besought that he might not be reduced to
utter beggary, and he did his best to retain the Duchy
of Cornwall and his estates at Sherborne. The former, as
he might have supposed, could not be left in the charge
of a prisoner. It was given to a friend, to the Earl of
Pembroke, and Raleigh showed a dangerous obstinacy
in refusing to give up the Seal of the Duchy direct to the
Earl; he was presently induced to resign it into Cecil's
hands, and then nothing but Sherborne remained. His
debts were 3,000<i>l.</i> His rich collections of plate and
tapestry had been confiscated or stolen. If the King
permitted Sherborne also to be taken, it would be impossible
to meet the exorbitant charges of the Lieutenant,
and under these circumstances it is only too probable
that Raleigh might have been obliged to crouch in the
traditional dungeon ten feet by eight feet. The retention
of Sherborne, then, meant comfort and the status of a
gentleman. It is therefore of the highest interest to us
to see what had become of Sherborne.</p>

<p>We have seen that up to the date of the trial Cecil
held at bay the Scottish jackals who went prowling
round the rich Dorsetshire manor; and when the trial
was over, Cecil, as Lady Raleigh said, 'hath been our
only comfort in our lamentable misfortune.' As soon
as Raleigh was condemned, commissioners hastened
down to Sherborne and began to prepare the division
of the prize. They sold the cattle, and began to root up
the copses. They made considerable progress in dismantling
the house itself. Raleigh appealed to the
Lords of the Council, and Cecil sent down two trustees,
who, in February 1604, put a sudden stop to all this
havoc, and sent the commissioners about their business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Of the latter, one was the infamous Meeres, Raleigh's
former bailiff, and this fact was particularly galling to
Raleigh. On July 30 in the same year, Sherborne
Castle and the surrounding manors were conveyed to
Sir Alexander Brett and others in trust for Lady
Raleigh and her son Walter, Sir Walter nominally
forfeiting the life interest in the estates which he had
reserved to himself in the conveyance of 1602. On the
moneys collected by these trustees Lady Raleigh supported
herself and her husband also. She was not turned
out of the castle at first. Twice at least in 1605 we find
her there, on the second occasion causing all the armour
to be scoured. Some persons afterwards considered that
this act was connected with Gunpowder Plot, others
maintained that it was merely due to the fact that the
armour was rusty. The great point is that she was
still mistress of Sherborne. Lord Justice Popham, however,
as early as 1604, pronounced Raleigh's act of
conveyance invalid, and in 1608 negotiations began for
a 'purchase,' or rather a confiscation of Sherborne to
the King. To this we shall presently return. In the
meanwhile Captain Keymis acted as warden of Sherborne
Castle.</p>

<p>As soon as the warm weather closed in, in the
summer of 1604, the malaria in the Tower began to
affect Raleigh's health. As he tells Cecil, now Lord
Cranborne, in a most dolorous letter, he was withering
in body and mind. The plague had come close to him,
his son having lain a fortnight with only a paper wall
between him and a woman whose child was dying of that
terrible complaint. Lady Raleigh, at last, had been
able to bear the terror of infection no longer, and had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
departed with little Walter. Raleigh thereupon, in a
fit of extreme dejection, 'presumed to tell their Lordships
of his miserable estate, daily in danger of death by
the palsy, nightly of suffocation by wasted and obstructed
lungs.' He entreated to be removed to more wholesome
lodgings. His prayer was not answered. Earlier in the
year he had indeed enjoyed a short excursion from the
Tower. At Easter the King had come to attend a bull-baiting
on Tower Hill, and Raleigh was hastily removed
to the Fleet prison beforehand, lest the etiquette of such
occasions should oblige James, against his inclination, to
give obnoxious prisoners their liberty. Raleigh was one
of five persons so hurried to the Fleet on March 25: on
the next day the King came, and 'caused all the prisons
of the Tower to be opened, and all the persons then within
them to be released.' After the bull-baiting was over,
the excepted prisoners were quietly brought back again.
This little change was all the variety that Raleigh
enjoyed until he left for Guiana in 1617.</p>

<p>When it transpired in 1605 that through, as it
appears, the negligence of the copying clerk, the conveyance
by which Raleigh thought that he had secured
Sherborne to his son was null and void, he had to suffer
from a vindictive attack from his wife herself. She,
poor woman, had now for nearly two years bustled
hither and thither, intriguing in not always the most
judicious manner for her family, but never resting,
never leaving a stone unturned which might lead
to their restitution. The sudden discovery that the
lawyers had found a flaw in the conveyance was more
than her overstrung nerves could endure, and in a fit of
temper she attacked her husband, and rushed about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
town denouncing him. Raleigh, in deepest depression
of mind and body, wrote to Cecil, who had now taken
another upward step in the hierarchy of James's protean
House of Lords, and who was Earl of Salisbury henceforward:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of the true cause of my importunities, one is, that I am
every second or third night in danger either of sudden
death, or of the loss of my limbs or sense, being sometimes
two hours without feeling or motion of my hand and whole
arm. I complain not of it. I know it vain, for there is
none that hath compassion thereof. The other, that I shall
be made more than weary of my life by her crying and bewailing,
who will return in post when she hears of your
Lordship's departure, and nothing done. She hath already
brought her eldest son in one hand, and her sucking child
[Carew Raleigh, born in the winter of 1604] in another,
crying out of her and their destruction; charging me with
unnatural negligence, and that having provided for my own
life, I am without sense and compassion of theirs. These
torments, added to my desolate life&mdash;receiving nothing but
torments, and where I should look for some comfort,
together with the consideration of my cruel destiny, my
days and times worn out in trouble and imprisonment&mdash;is
sufficient either utterly to distract me, or to make me curse
the time that ever I was born into the world, and had a
being.</p></div>

<p>Things were not commonly in so bad a way as this,
we may be sure. Raleigh, who did nothing by halves,
was not accustomed to underrate his own misfortunes.
His health was uncertain, indeed, and it was still worse
in 1606; but his condition otherwise was not so deplorable
as this letter would tend to prove. Poor Lady
Raleigh soon recovered her equanimity, and the Lieu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>tenant
of the Tower, Sir George Harvey, indulged
Raleigh in a variety of ways. He frequently invited
him to his table; and finding that the prisoner was
engaged in various chemical experiments, he lent him
his private garden to set up his still in. In one of
Raleigh's few letters of this period, we get a delightful
little vignette. Raleigh is busy working in the
garden, and, the pale being down, the charming young
Lady Effingham, his old friend Nottingham's daughter,
strolls by along the terrace on the arm of the Countess
of Beaumont. The ladies lean over the paling, and
watch the picturesque old magician poring over his
crucibles, his face lighted up with the flames from his
furnace. They fall a chatting with him, and Lady
Effingham coaxes him to spare her a little of that famous
balsam which he brought back from Guiana. He tells
her that he has none prepared, but that he will send her
some by their common friend Captain Whitlock, and
presently he does so. A captivity which admitted such
communications with the outer world as this, could not
but have had its alleviations.</p>

<p>The letter quoted on the last page evidently belongs
to the summer of 1605, when, for a few months, Raleigh
was undoubtedly in great discomfort. On August 15, Sir
George Harvey was succeeded by Sir William Waad,
who had shown Raleigh great severity before his trial.
He, however, although not well disposed, shrank from
actually ill-treating his noble prisoner. He hinted to
Lord Salisbury that he wanted the garden for his own
use, and that he thought the paling an insufficient
barrier between Raleigh and the world. Meanwhile
Salisbury did not take the hint, and the brick wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Waad wished built up was not begun. Waad evidently
looked upon the chemical experiments with suspicion.
'Sir Walter Raleigh,' he wrote, 'hath converted a little
hen-house in the garden into a still, where he doth
spend his time all the day in his distillations.' Some
of the remedies which the prisoner invented became
exceedingly popular. His 'lesser cordial' of strawberry
water was extensively used by ladies, and his 'great
cordial,' which was understand to contain 'whatever is
most choice and sovereign in the animal, vegetable, and
mineral world,' continued to be a favourite panacea
until the close of the century.</p>

<p>When, in November, Gunpowder Plot was discovered,
Sir Walter Raleigh was for a moment suspected. No
evidence was found inculpating him in the slightest
degree; but his life was, for the moment at least, made
distinctly harder. When he returned from examination,
the wall which Waad had desired to put between the
prisoner and the public was in course of construction.
When finished it was not very formidable, for Waad
complains that Raleigh was in the habit of standing
upon it, in the sight of passers-by. The increased confinement
in the spring of 1606 brought his ill-health to
a climax. He thought he was about to suffer an apoplectic
seizure, and he was allowed to take medical
advice. The doctor's certificate, dated March 26, 1606,
is still in existence; it describes his paralytic symptoms,
and recommends that Sir Walter Raleigh should be
removed from the cold lodging which he was occupying
to the 'little room he hath built in the garden, and
joining his still-house,' which would be warmer. This
seems to have been done, and Raleigh's health improved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>During the year 1606 various attempts were made
to persuade the King to release Raleigh, but in vain.
The Queen had made his acquaintance, and had become
his friend, and there was a general hope that when her
father, the King of Denmark, came over to see James
in the summer, he would plead for Raleigh. There is
reason to believe that if he had done so with success,
he would have invited Raleigh to return with him, and
to become Admiral of the Danish fleet. But matters
never got so far as this. James I. had an inkling of what
was coming, and he took an early opportunity of saying
to Christian IV., 'Promise me that you will be no man's
solicitor.' In spite of this, before he left England,
Christian did ask for Raleigh's pardon, and was refused.
When he had left England, and all hope was over, in
September, Lady Raleigh made her way to Hampton
Court, and, pushing her way into the King's presence,
fell on her knees at his feet. James went by, and
neither spoke nor looked at her. It must have been about
this time, or a little later, that Queen Anne brought
her unfortunate eldest son Henry to visit Raleigh at
the Tower. Prince Henry, born in 1594, was now only
twelve years of age. His intimacy with Sir Walter
Raleigh belongs rather to the years 1610 to 1612.</p>

<p>In February 1607, Raleigh was exposed to some
annoyance from Edward Cotterell, the servant who in
1603 had carried his injudicious correspondence with
Lord Cobham to and fro. This man had remained in
Lady Raleigh's service, and attended on her in her little
house, opposite her husband's rooms, on Tower Hill.
He professed to be able to give evidence against his
master, but in examination before the Lord Chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Justice nothing intelligible could be extracted from him.
About the same time we find Raleigh, encouraged, it
would appear, by the Queen, proposing to Lord Salisbury
that he should be allowed to go to Guiana on an expedition
for gold. It is pathetic to read the earnest
phrases in which he tries to wheedle out of the cold
Minister permission to set out westward once more
across the ocean that he loved so much. He offers, lest
he should be looked upon as a runagate, to leave his
wife and children behind him as hostages; and the
Queen and Lord Salisbury may have the treasure he
brings back, if only he may go. He pleads how rich
the land is, and how no one knows the way to it as he
does. We seem to hear the very accents of another
weary King of the Sea:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis not too late to seek a newer world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the western stars until I die.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such was Raleigh's purpose; but it was not that of
James and of Salisbury. On the contrary, he was kept a
faster prisoner. In July 1607, fresh regulations came
into force in the Tower, by which at 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Raleigh and
his servants had to retire to their own apartments, and
Lady Raleigh go back to her house, nor were guests
any longer to be admitted in the evening. Lady
Raleigh had particularly offended Sir William Waad by
driving into the Tower in her coach. She was informed
that she must do so no more. It was probably these
long quiet evenings which specially predisposed Raleigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to literary composition. He borrowed books, mainly
of an historical character, in all directions. A letter
to Sir Robert Cotton is extant in which he desires the
loan of no less than thirteen obscure and bulky historians,
and we may imagine his silent evenings spent in
poring over the precious manuscripts of the <i>Annals of
Tewkesbury</i> and the <i>Chronicle of Evesham</i>. In this year
young Walter Raleigh, now fourteen years of age, proceeded
to Oxford, and matriculated at Corpus on October
30, 1607. His tutors were a certain Hooker, and the
brilliant young theologian, Dr. Daniel Featley, afterwards
to be famous as a controversial divine. Throughout
the year 1608, Raleigh, buried in his <i>History</i>, makes
no sign to us.</p>

<p>Early in 1609, the uncertain tenure of Sherborne,
which had vexed Raleigh so much that he declared
himself ready to part with the estate in exchange for
the pleasure of never hearing of it again, once more
came definitely before the notice of the Government. A
proposition had been made to Raleigh to sell his right
in it to the King, but he had refused; he said that it
belonged to his wife and child, and that 'those that
never had a fee-simple could not grant a fee-simple.'
About Christmas 1608 Lady Raleigh brought the
matter up again, and leading her sons by the hand she
appeared in the Presence Chamber, and besought James
to give them a new conveyance, with no flaw in it.
But the King had determined to seize Sherborne, and
he told her, 'I maun hae the lond, I maun hae it for
Carr.' It is said that, losing all patience, Elizabeth
Raleigh started to her feet, and implored God to punish
this robbery of her household. Sir Walter was more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
politic, and on January 2, 1609, he wrote a letter to the
favourite, imploring him not to covet Sherborne. It
is to be regretted that Raleigh, whose opinion of James's
minions was not on private occasions concealed, should
write to Carr of all people in England as 'one whom I
know not, but by an honourable fame;' and that the
eloquence of his appeal should be thrown away on such
a recipient. 'For yourself, Sir,' he says, 'seeing your
day is but now in the dawn, and mine come to the
evening, your own virtues and the King's grace assuring
you of many good fortunes and much honour, I beseech
you not to begin your first building upon the
ruins of the innocent; and that their griefs and sorrows
do not attend your first plantation.' Carr, of course,
took no notice whatever, and on the 10th of the same
month the estates at Sherborne were bestowed on him.
At Prince Henry's request the King presently purchased
them back again, and gave them to his son, who soon
after died. Mr. Edwards has discovered that Sherborne
passed through eight successive changes of ownership
before 1617. To Lady Raleigh and her children the
King gave 8,000<i>l.</i> as purchase-money of the life security
in Sherborne. The interest on this sum was
very irregularly paid, and the Guiana voyage in 1617
swallowed up most of the principal. Thus the vast and
princely fortune of Raleigh melted away like a drift of
snow.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1611, Raleigh came into collision
with Lord Salisbury and Lord Northampton on some
matter at present obscure. Northampton writes: 'We
had afterwards a bout with Sir Walter Raleigh, in
whom we find no change, but the same blindness, pride,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and passion that heretofore hath wrought more violently,
but never expressed itself in a stranger fashion.' In consequence
of their interview with Raleigh and other prisoners,
the Lords recommended that 'the lawless liberty'
of the Tower should no longer be allowed to cocker and
foster exorbitant hopes in the braver sort of captives.
Raleigh was immediately placed under closer restraint,
not even being allowed to take his customary walk with
his keeper up the hill within the Tower. His private
garden and gallery were taken from him, and his wife
was almost entirely excluded from his company. The
final months of Salisbury's life were unfavourable to
Raleigh, and there was no quickening of the old friendship
at the last. When Lord Salisbury died on May 24,
1612, Raleigh wrote this epigram:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here lies Hobinall our pastor whilere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once in a quarter our fleeces did sheer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please us, his cur he kept under clog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was ever after both shepherd and dog;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For oblation to Pan, his custom was thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He first gave a trifle, then offered up us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through his false worship such power he did gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As kept him on the mountain, and us on the plain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When these lines were shown to James I. he said he
hoped that the man who wrote them would die before
he did.</p>

<p>The death of Salisbury encouraged Raleigh once
more. His intimacy with the generous and promising
Prince of Wales had quickened his hopes. During the
last months of his life, Henry continually appealed to
Raleigh for advice. The Prince was exceedingly interested
in all matters of navigation and shipbuilding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and there exists a letter to him from Raleigh giving
him elaborate counsel on the building of a man-of-war,
from which we may learn that in the opinion of that
practised hand six things were chiefly required in a
well-conditioned ship of the period: '1, that she be
strong built; 2, swift in sail; 3, stout-sided; 4, that
her ports be so laid, as she may carry out her guns all
weathers; 5, that she hull and try well; 6, that she
stay well, when boarding or turning on a wind is required.'
Secure in the interest of the Prince of Wales,
and hoping to persuade the Queen to be an adventurer,
Raleigh seized the opportunity of the death of Salisbury
to communicate his plans for an expedition to Guiana
to the Lords of the Council. He thought he had induced
them to promise that Captain Keymis should go,
and that if so much as half a ton of gold was brought
back, that should buy Raleigh his liberty. But the
negotiations fell through, and Keymis stayed at home.</p>

<p>In September 1612, Raleigh was writing the second
of his <i>Marriage Discourses</i>, that dealing with the prospects
of his best and youngest friend. A month later
that friend fell a victim to his extreme rashness in the
neglect of his health. The illness of the Prince of
Wales filled the whole of England with dismay, and
when, on November 6, he sank under the attack of
typhoid fever, it was felt to be a national misfortune.
On the very morning of his death the Queen sent
to Raleigh for his famous cordial, and it was forwarded,
with the message that if it was not poison that
the Prince was dying of, it must save him. The Queen
herself believed that Raleigh's cordial had once saved
her life; on the other hand, in the preceding August<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
his medicines were vulgarly supposed to have hastened
the death of Sir Philip Sidney's daughter, the Countess
of Rutland. The cordial soothed the Prince's last
agony, and that was all. Henry had with great difficulty
obtained from his father the promise that, as a
personal favour to himself, Raleigh should be set at
liberty at Christmas 1612. He died six weeks too soon,
and the King contrived to forget his promise. The
feeling of the Prince of Wales towards Raleigh was expressed
in a phrase that was often repeated, 'No man
but my father would keep such a bird in a cage.'</p>

<p>We learn from Izaak Walton that Ben Jonson was
recommended to Raleigh while he was in the Tower,
by Camden. That he helped him in obtaining and
arranging material for the <i>History of the World</i> is
certain. In 1613 young Walter Raleigh, having returned
to London, and having, in the month of April,
killed his man in a duel, went abroad under the charge
of Jonson. They took letters for Prince Maurice of
Nassau, and they proceeded to Paris, but we know
no more. It was probably before they started that
young Walter wheeled the corpulent poet of the <i>Alchemist</i>
into his father's presence in a barrow, Ben
Jonson being utterly overwhelmed with a beaker of
that famed canary that he loved too well. Jonson, on
his return from abroad, seems to have superintended
the publication of the <i>History of the World</i> in 1614. A
fine copy of verses, printed opposite the frontispiece of
that volume, was reprinted among the pieces called
<i>Underwoods</i> in the 1641 folio of Ben Jonson's <i>Works</i>.
These lines have, therefore, ever since been attributed
to that poet, but, as it appears to me, rashly. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
first place, this volume was posthumous; in the second,
for no less than twenty-three years Ben Jonson allowed
the verses to appear as Raleigh's without protest; in
the third, where they differ from the earlier version it
is always to their poetical disadvantage. They were
found, as the editor of 1641 says, amongst Jonson's
papers, and I would suggest, as a new hypothesis, that
the less polished draft in the <i>Underwoods</i> is entirely
Raleigh's, having been copied by Jonson verbatim when
he was preparing the <i>History of the World</i> for the press,
and that the improved expressions in the latter were
adopted by Raleigh on suggestion from the superior
judgment of Jonson. The character of the verse is
peculiarly that of Raleigh.</p>

<p>It was in 1607, as I have conjectured, that Raleigh
first began seriously to collect and arrange materials for
the <i>History of the World</i>; in 1614 he presented the first
and only volume of this gigantic enterprise to the public.
It was a folio of 1,354 pages, printed very closely, and
if reprinted now would fill about thirty-five such volumes
as are devised for an ordinary modern novel. Yet it
brought the history of the world no lower down than
the conquest of Macedon by Rome, and it is hard to
conceive how soon, at this rate of production, Raleigh
would have reached his own generation. He is said to
have anticipated that his book would need to consist of
not less than four such folios. In the opening lines he
expresses some consciousness of the fact that it was late
in life for him, a prisoner of State condemned to death
at the King's pleasure, to undertake so vast a literary
adventure. 'Had it been begotten,' he confesses, 'with
my first dawn of day, when the light of common know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ledge
began to open itself to my younger years, and
before any wound received either from fortune or time,
I might yet well have doubted that the darkness of age
and death would have covered over both it and me, long
before the performance.' It is greatly to be desired that
Raleigh could have been as well advised as his contemporary
and possible friend, the Huguenot poet-soldier,
Agrippa d'Aubign&eacute;, who at the close of a chequered
career also prepared a <i>Histoire Universelle</i>, in which he
simply told the story of his own political party in France
through those stormy years in which he himself had
been an actor. We would gladly exchange all these
chronicles of Semiramis and Jehoshaphat for a plain
statement of what Raleigh witnessed in the England of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The student of Raleigh does not, therefore, rise from
an examination of his author's chief contribution to literature
without a severe sense of disappointment. The
book is brilliant almost without a rival in its best passages,
but these are comparatively few, and they are
divided from one another by tracts of pathless desert.
The narrative sometimes descends into a mere slough
of barbarous names, a marish of fabulous genealogy,
in which the lightest attention must take wings to be
supported at all. For instance, the geographical and
historical account of the Ten Tribes occupies a space
equivalent to a modern octavo volume of at least four
hundred pages, through which, if the conscientious
reader would pass 'treading the crude consistence' of
the matter, 'behoves him now both sail and oar.' It is
not fair to dwell upon the eminent beauties of the
<i>History of the World</i> without at the same time acknow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>ledging
that the book almost wilfully deprives itself of
legitimate value and true human interest by the remoteness
of the period which it describes, and by the tiresome
pedantry of its method. It is leisurely to the last
excess. The first chapter, of seven long sections, takes
us but to the close of the Creation. We cannot proceed
without knowing what it is that Tostatus affirms of the
empyrean heavens, and whether, with Strabo, we may
dare assume that they are filled with angels. To hasten
onwards would be impossible, so long as one of the errors
of Steuchius Eugubinus remains unconfuted; and even
then it is well to pause until we know the opinions of
Orpheus and Zoroaster on the matter in hand. One
whole chapter of four sections is dedicated to the Tree
of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the arguments of
Goropius Becanus are minutely tested and found wanting.
Goropius Becanus, whom Raleigh is never tired of
shaking between his critical teeth, was a learned Jesuit
of Antwerp, who proved that Adam and Eve spoke
Dutch in Paradise. It is not until he reaches the
Patriarchs that it begins to occur to the historian that
at his present rate of progress it will need forty folio
volumes, and not four, to complete his labours. From
this point he hastens a little, as the compilers of encyclop&aelig;dias
do when they have passed the letter B.</p>

<p>With all this, the <i>History of the World</i> is a charming
and delightful miscellany, if we do not accept it too
seriously. Often for a score of pages there will be
something brilliant, something memorable on every leaf,
and there is not a chapter, however arid, without its
fine things somewhere. It is impossible to tell where
Raleigh's pen will take fire. He is most exquisite and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
fanciful where his subject is most unhopeful, and, on the
other hand, he is likely to disappoint us where we take
for granted that he will be fine. For example, the series
of sections on the Terrestrial Paradise are singularly
crabbed and dusty in their display of Rabbinical
pedantry, and the little touch in praise of Guiana is
almost the only one that redeems the general dryness.
It is not mirth, or beauty, or luxury that fires the
historian, but death. Of mortality he has always some
rich sententious thing to say, praising 'the workmanship
of death, that finishes the sorrowful business of a
wretched life.' So the most celebrated passages of the
whole book, and perhaps the finest, are the address to
God which opens the <i>History</i>, and the prose hymn in
praise of death which closes it. The entire absence of
humour is characteristic, and adds to the difficulty of
reading the book straight on. The story of Periander's
burning the clothes of the women closes with a jest;
there is, perhaps, no other occasion on which the solemn
historian is detected with a smile upon his lips.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting and readable, part of the
<i>History of the World</i> is its preface. This is a book in
itself, and one in which the author condescends to a
lively human interest. We cheerfully pass from Elihu
the Buzite, and the conjectures of Adricomius respecting
the family of Ram, to the actualities of English and
Continental history in the generation immediately preceding
that in which Raleigh was writing. When we
consider the position in which the author stood towards
James I. and turn to the pages of his Preface, we refuse
to believe that it was without design that he expressed
himself in language so extraordinary. It would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
been mere levity for a friendless prisoner, ready for the
block, to publish this terrible arraignment of the crimes
of tyrant kings, unless he had some reason for believing
that he could shelter himself successfully under a powerful
sympathy. This sympathy, in the case of Sir Walter
Raleigh, could be none other than that of Prince Henry;
and it may well have been in the summer of 1612, when,
as we know, he was particularly intimate with the Prince
and busied in his affairs, that he wrote the Preface.
With long isolation from the world, he had lost touch
of public affairs, as <i>The Prerogative of Parliament</i> would
alone be sufficient to show. It is probable that he exaggerated
the influence of the young Prince, and estimated
too highly the promise of liberty which he had
wrung from his father.</p>

<p>It took James some time to discover that this grave
Rabbinical miscellany, inspired by Siracides and Goropius
Becanus, was not wholesome reading for his
subjects. On January 5, 1615, after the book had been
selling slowly, the King gave an order commanding the
suppression of the remainder of the edition, giving as
his reason that 'it is too saucy in censuring the acts of
kings.' It is said that some favoured person at Court
pushed inquiry further, and extracted from James the
explanation that the censure of Henry VIII. was the
real cause of the suppression. Contemporary anecdote,
however, has reported that the defamation of the
Tudors in the Preface to the <i>History of the World</i> might
have passed without reproof, if the King had not discovered
in the very body of the book several passages so
ambiguously worded that he could not but suspect the
writer of intentional satire. According to this story, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was startled at Raleigh's account of Naboth's Vineyard,
and scandalised at the description of the impeachment
of the Admiral of France; but what finally drew him up,
and made him decide that the book must perish, was
the character of King Ninias, son of Queen Semiramis.
This passage, then, may serve us as an example of the
<i>History of the World</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ninus being the first whom the madness of boundless
dominion transported, invaded his neighbour princes, and
became victorious over them; a man violent, insolent, and
cruel. Semiramis taking the opportunity, and being more
proud, adventurous, and ambitious than her paramour,
enlarged the Babylonian empire, and beautified many places
therein with buildings unexampled. But her son having
changed nature and condition with his mother, proved no
less feminine than she was masculine. And as wounds and
wrongs, by their continual smart, put the patient in mind
how to cure the one and revenge the other, so those kings
adjoining (whose subjection and calamities incident were
but new, and therefore the more grievous) could not sleep,
when the advantage was offered by such a successor. For
<i>in regno Babylonico hic parum resplenduit</i>: 'This king
shined little,' saith Nauclerus of Ninias, 'in the Babylonian
kingdom.' And likely it is, that the necks of mortal men
having been never before galled with the yoke of foreign
dominion, nor having ever had experience of that most
miserable and detested condition of living in slavery; no
long descent having as yet invested the Assyrian with a
right, nor any other title being for him pretended than a
strong hand; the foolish and effeminate son of a tyrannous
and hated mother could very ill hold so many great princes
and nations his vassals, with a power less mastering, and a
mind less industrious, than his father and mother had used
before him.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>It is in passages like this, where we read the satire
between the lines, and in those occasional fragments of
autobiography to which we have already referred in the
course of this narrative, that the secondary charm of the
<i>History of the World</i> resides. It is to these that we
turn when we have exhausted our first surprise and delight
at the great bursts of poetic eloquence, the long
sonorous sentences which break like waves on the shore,
when the spirit of the historian is roused by some occasional
tempest of reflection. In either case, the book is
essentially one to glean from, not to read with consecutive
patience. Real historical philosophy is absolutely
wanting. The author strives to seem impartial by introducing,
in the midst of an account of the slaughter of
the Amalekites, a chapter on 'The Instauration of Civility
in Europe, and of Prometheus and Atlas;' but his general
notions of history are found to be as rude as his comparative
mythology. He scarcely attempts to sift evidence,
and next to Inspiration he knows no guide more trustworthy
than Pintus or Haytonus, a Talmudic rabbi or
a Jesuit father. In the midst of his disquisitions, the
reward of the continuous reader is to come suddenly
upon an unexpected 'as I myself have seen in America,'
or 'as once befell me also in Ireland.'</p>

<p>Another historical work, the <i>Breviary of the History
of England</i>, has been claimed for Sir Walter Raleigh.
This book was first published in 1692, from a manuscript
in the possession of Archbishop Sancroft, and, as it
would appear, in Raleigh's handwriting. Before its
publication, however, the Archbishop had noted that
'Samuel Daniel hath inserted into his <i>History of England</i>
[1618], almost word for word, both the Introduction and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the Life; whence it is that you have sometimes in the
margin of my copy a various reading with "D" after
it.' Daniel, a gentle and subservient creature, was the
friend of Camden, and a paid servant of Queen Anne,
during Raleigh's imprisonment. He died a few months
after Raleigh's execution. It is very likely that he was
useful to Raleigh in collecting notes and other material.
It may even have been his work for the interesting
prisoner in the Tower that caused Jonson's jealous dislike
of Daniel. The younger poet's own account, as
Mr. Edwards pointed out, by no means precludes
the supposition that he used material put together by
another hand. At the same time Sancroft's authority
cannot be considered final as regards Raleigh's authorship
of the <i>Breviary</i>, for the manuscript did not come
into his hands until nineteen years after Raleigh's
death.</p>

<p>No such doubt attaches to the very curious and
interesting volume published nominally at Middelburg
in 1628, and entitled <i>The Prerogative of Parliament</i>.
This takes the form of a dialogue between a Counsellor
of State and a Justice of the Peace. The dramatic
propriety is but poorly sustained, and presently the
Justice becomes Raleigh, speaking in his own person.
The book was written in the summer of 1615, a few
months after the suppression of the <i>History of the World</i>,
and by a curious misconstruction of motive was intended
to remove from the King's mind the unpleasant
impression caused by those parables of Ahab and of
Ninias. It had, however, as we shall see, the very
opposite result. The preface to the King expresses an
almost servile desire to please: 'it would be more dog-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>like
than man-like to bite the stone that struck me, to
wit the borrowed authority of my sovereign misinformed.'
But Raleigh was curiously misinformed himself regarding
the ways and wishes of James. His dialogue takes
for its starting-point the trial of Oliver St. John, who
had been Raleigh's fellow-prisoner in the Tower since
April for having with unreasonable brutality protested
against the enforced payment of what was called the
Benevolence, a supposed free-will offering to the purse
of the King. So ignorant was Raleigh of what was
going on in England, that he fancied James to be
unaware of the tricks of his ministers; and the argument
of <i>The Prerogative of Parliament</i> is to encourage the
King to cast aside his evil counsellors, and come face
to face with his loyal people. The student of Mr.
Gardiner's account of the Benevolence will smile to
think of the rage with which the King must have
received Raleigh's proffered good advice, and of Raleigh's
stupefaction at learning that his well-meant volume was
forbidden to be printed. His manuscript, prepared for
the press, still remains among the State Papers, and it
was not until ten years after his death that it was first
timidly issued under the imprints of Middelburg and
of Hamburg.</p>

<p>Not the least of Raleigh's chagrins in the Tower
must have been the composition of works which he was
unable to publish. It is probable that several of these
are still unknown to the world; many were certainly
destroyed, some may still be in existence. During the
thirty years which succeeded his execution, there was a
considerable demand for scraps of Raleigh's writing on
the part of men who were leaning to the Liberal side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
John Hampden was a collector of Raleigh's manuscripts,
and he is possibly the friend who bequeathed to Milton
the manuscript of <i>The Cabinet Council</i>, an important
political work of Raleigh's which the great Puritan
poet gave to the world in 1658. At that time Milton
had had the treatise 'many years in my hands, and
finding it lately by chance among other books and
papers, upon reading thereof I thought it a kind of
injury to withhold longer the work of so eminent an
author from the public.' <i>The Cabinet Council</i> is a study
in the manner of Macchiavelli. It treats of the arts
of empire and mysteries of State-craft, mainly with
regard to the duties of monarchy. It is remarkable for
the extraordinary richness of allusive extracts from the
Roman classics, almost every maxim being immediately
followed by an apt Latin example. At the end of the
twenty-fourth chapter the author wakes up to the
tedious character of this manner of instruction, and the
rest of the book is illustrated by historical instances in
the English tongue. The book closes with an exhortation
to the reader, who could be no other than Prince
Henry, to emulate the conduct of Amurath, King of
Turbay, who abandoned worldly glory to embrace a
retired life of contemplation. <i>The Cabinet Council</i> must
be regarded as a text-book of State-craft, intended <i>in
usum Delphini</i>.</p>

<p>Probably earlier in date, and certainly more elegant
in literary form, is the treatise entitled <i>A Discourse
of War</i>. This may be recommended to the modern
reader as the most generally pleasing of Raleigh's prose
compositions, and the one in which, owing to its modest
limits, the peculiarities of his style may be most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
conveniently studied. The last passage of the little book
forms one of the most charming pages of the literature
of that time, and closes with a pathetic and dignified
statement of Raleigh's own attitude towards war. 'It
would be an unspeakable advantage, both to the public
and private, if men would consider that great truth,
that no man is wise or safe but he that is honest. All
I have designed is peace to my country; and may
England enjoy that blessing when I shall have no more
proportion in it than what my ashes make.' There is
no reason to doubt the sincerity of these words; yet we
must not forget that this pacific light was not that in
which Raleigh's character had presented itself to Robert
Cecil or to Elizabeth.</p>

<p>None of Raleigh's biographers have suggested any
employment for his leisure during the year which
followed his release from the Tower. Yet the expressions
he used in the preface to his <i>Observations on Trade
and Commerce</i> show that it must have been prepared during
the year 1616 or 1617: 'about fourteen or fifteen
years past,' that is to say in 1602, 'I presented you,' he
says to the King, 'a book of extraordinary importance.'
He complains that this earlier book was suppressed,
and hopes for better luck; but the same misfortune,
as usual with Raleigh, attended the <i>Observations</i>. That
treatise was an impassioned plea, based upon a
survey of the commercial condition of the world, in
favour of free trade. Raleigh looked with grave
suspicion on the various duties which were levied, in
increasing amount, on foreign goods entering this
country, and he entreated James I. to allow him to
nominate commissioners to examine into the causes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the depression of trade, and to revise the tariffs on a
liberal basis. It must have seemed to the King that
Raleigh wilfully opposed every royal scheme which he
examined. James had been a protectionist all through
his reign, and at this very moment was busy in attempting
to force the native industries to flourish in spite of
foreign competition. Raleigh's treatise must have been
put into the King's hands much about the time at
which his violent protectionism was threatening to
draw England into war with Holland. Raleigh's advice
seems to us wise and pointed, but to James it can only
have appeared wilfully wrong-headed. The <i>Observations
upon Trade</i> disappeared as so many of Raleigh's manuscripts
had disappeared before it, and was only first
published in the <i>Remains</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of 1651.</p>

<p>Of the last three years of Raleigh's imprisonment in
the Tower we know scarcely anything. On September
27, 1615, a fellow-prisoner in whom Raleigh could not
fail to take an interest, Lady Arabella Stuart, died in the
Tower. In December, Raleigh was deprived, by an order
in Council, of Arabella's rich collection of pearls, but
how they had come into his possession we cannot guess.
Nor can we date the stroke of apoplexy from which
Raleigh suffered about this time. But relief was now
briefly coming. Two of Raleigh's worst enemies, Northampton
and Somerset, were removed, and in their successors,
Winwood and Villiers, Raleigh found listeners
more favourable to his projects. It has been said that
he owed his release to bribery, but Mr. Gardiner thinks
it needless to suppose this. Winwood was as cordial a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
hater of Spain as Raleigh himself; and Villiers, in his
political animus against the Somerset faction, would need
no bribery. Sir William St. John was active in bringing
Raleigh's claims before the Court, and the Queen, as
ever, used what slender influence she possessed. Urged
on so many sides, James gave way, and on January 30,
1616, signed a warrant for Raleigh's release from the
Tower. He was to live in his own house, but, with a
keeper; he was not to presume to visit the Court, or
the Queen's apartments, nor go to any public assemblies
whatever, and his whole attention was to be given
to making due preparations for the intended voyage to
Guiana. This warrant, although Raleigh used it to leave
his confinement, was only provisional; and was confirmed
by a minute of the Privy Council on March 19.
Raleigh took a house in Broad Street, where he spent
fourteen months in discreet retirement, and then sailed
on his last voyage.</p>

<h3>THE SECOND VOYAGE TO GUIANA.</h3>


<p>Raleigh had been released from the Tower expressly
on the understanding that he should make direct preparations
for a voyage to Guiana. The object of this
voyage was to enrich King James with the produce of a
mine close to the banks of the Orinoco. In the reign of
Elizabeth, Raleigh had stoutly contended that the natives
of Guiana had ceded all sovereignty in that country to
England in 1595, and that English colonists therefore
had no one's leave to ask there. But times had changed,
and he now no longer pretended that he had a right to
the Orinoco; he was careful to insist that his expedition
would infringe no privileges of Spain. He was
anxious by every diplomatic subtlety to avoid failure,
and for the first few months he kept extremely quiet.
He had called in the 8,000<i>l.</i> which had been lying at
interest ever since he had received it as part of the compensation
for the Sherborne estates. Lady Raleigh had
raised 2,500<i>l.</i> by the sale of some lands at Mitcham.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
5000<i>l.</i> more were brought together by various expedients,
some being borrowed in Amsterdam through the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
merchant, Pieter Vanlore,' and 15,000<i>l.</i> were contributed
by Raleigh's friends, who looked upon his enterprise
much as men at the present day would regard a promising
but rather hazardous investment.</p>

<p>His first business was to build one large ship of 440
tons in the Thames. This he named the 'Destiny,' and
he received no check in fitting her up to his desire;
the King paid 700 crowns, as the usual statutable
bounty on shipbuilding, without objection. At the
same time Raleigh built or collected six other smaller
vessels, and furnished them all with ordnance. The
preparation of such a fleet in the Thames could not pass
unobserved by the representatives of the foreign courts,
and during the last six months of 1616 Raleigh's name
became the centre of a tangle of diplomatic intrigue,
and one which frequently occurs in the correspondence
of Sarmiento, better known afterwards as Gondomar, the
Spanish ambassador, and in that of Des Mar&ecirc;ts, the
French ambassador. Mr. Edwards has remarked, with
complete justice, that the last two years of Raleigh's life
were simply 'a protracted death-struggle between him
and Gondomar.' The latter had been in England since
1613, and had acquired a singular art in dealing with
the purposes of James I. At the English Court during
1616 we find Spain watching France, and Venice watching
Savoy, all of them intent on Raleigh's movements
in the river. For the unravelment of these intrigues
in detail, the reader must be referred to Mr. Gardiner's
masterly pages.</p>

<p>On August 26, a royal commission was issued, by
which Raleigh was made the commander of an expedition
to Guiana, under express orders, more stringently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
expressed than usual, not to visit the dominions of any
Christian prince. This was to allay the alarm of the
Spanish ambassador, who from the first rumour of
Raleigh's voyage had not ceased to declare that its
real object was piracy, and probably the capture of the
Mexican plate fleet. At the same time James I. allowed
Gondomar to obtain possession of copies of certain
documents which Raleigh had drawn out at the royal
command describing his intended route, and these were
at once forwarded to Madrid, together with such information
as Gondomar had been able to glean in conversation
with Raleigh. Spain instantly replied by
offering him an escort to his gold mine and back, but
of course Raleigh declined the proposition. He continued
to assert that he had no piratical intention, and
that any man might peacefully enter Guiana without
asking leave of Spain.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether the anecdote is true which
records that Raleigh at this time applied to Bacon to
know whether the terms of his commission were tantamount
to a free pardon, and was told that they were.
But it rests on much better testimony that Bacon asked
him what he would do if the Guiana mine proved a
deception. Raleigh admitted that he would then look
out for the Mexican plate fleet. 'But then you will
be pirates,' said Bacon; and Raleigh answered, 'Ah,
who ever heard of men being pirates for millions?'
There was no exaggeration in this; the Mexican fleet
of that year was valued at two millions and a half. The
astute Gondomar was at least half certain that this was
Raleigh's real intention, and by October 12 he had persuaded
James to give him still more full security that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
no injury should be done, at the peril of Raleigh's life,
to any subject or property of the King of Spain.</p>

<p>The building of the 'Destiny' meanwhile proceeded,
and Raleigh received many important visitors on board
her. He was protected by the cordial favour of the
Secretary, Sir Ralph Winwood; and if the King disliked
him as much as ever, no animosity was shown. In the
first days of 1617, Raleigh ventured upon a daring act
of intrigue. He determined to work upon the growing
sympathy of the English Court with Savoy and its tension
with Spain, to strike a blow against the rich enemy
of the one and ally of the other, Genoa. He proposed
to Scarnafissi, the Savoyard envoy in London, that
James I. should be induced to allow the Guiana expedition
to steal into the Mediterranean, and seize Genoa
for Savoy. Scarnafissi laid the proposal before James,
and on January 12 it was discussed in the presence of
Winwood. There was talk of increasing Raleigh's fleet
for this purpose by the addition of a squadron of sixteen
ships from the royal navy. For a fortnight the idea
was discussed in secret; but on the 26th, Scarnafissi was
told that the King had determined not to adopt it.
Four days later Raleigh was released from the personal
attendance of a keeper, and though still not pardoned,
was pronounced free. On February 10, the Venetian
envoy, who had been taken into Scarnafissi's counsel,
announced to his Government that the King had finally
determined to keep Raleigh to his original intention.</p>

<p>Raleigh was next assailed by secret propositions
from France. Through the month of February various
Frenchmen visited him on the 'Destiny,' besides the
ambassador, Des Mar&ecirc;ts. He was nearly persuaded, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
defiance of James, to support the projected Huguenot
rebellion by capturing St. Val&eacute;ry. To find out the
truth regarding his intention, Des Mar&ecirc;ts paid at least
one visit to the 'Destiny,' and on March 7 gave his
Government an account of a conversation with Raleigh,
in which the latter had spoken bitterly of James, and
had asserted his affection for France, and desire to serve
her. It is in the correspondence of Des Mar&ecirc;ts that
the names of Raleigh and Richelieu become for a moment
connected; it was in February 1617 that the future
Cardinal described his English contemporary as 'Ouastre
Raly, grand marinier et mauvais capitaine.' In March
the English Government, to allay fresh apprehensions
on the part of Spain, forwarded by Gondomar most
implicit assertions that Raleigh's expedition should be
in no way injurious to Spain. And so it finally started
after all, not bound for Mexico, or Genoa, or St. Val&eacute;ry,
but for the Orinoco. Up to the last, Gondomar protested,
and his protestations were only put aside after a
special council of March 28. Next day Raleigh rode
down to Dover to go on board the 'Destiny,' which had
left the Thames on the 26th.</p>

<p>His fleet of seven vessels was not well manned.
His own account of the crews is thus worded in the
<i>Apology</i>: 'A company of volunteers who for the most
part had neither seen the sea nor the wars; who, some
forty gentlemen excepted, were the very scum of the
world, drunkards, blasphemers, and such others as their
fathers, brothers, and friends thought it an exceeding
good gain to be discharged of, with the hazard of some
thirty, forty, or fifty pound.' He was himself Admiral,
with his son Walter as captain of the 'Destiny;' Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
William Sentleger was on the 'Thunder;' a certain
John Bailey commanded the 'Husband.' The remaining
vessels were the 'Jason,' the 'Encounter,' the
'Flying Joan,' and the 'Page.' The master of the
'Destiny' was John Burwick, 'a hypocritical thief.'
Various tiresome delays occurred. They waited for the
'Thunder' at the Isle of Wight; and when the rest
went on to Plymouth, the 'Jason' stayed behind ignominiously
in Portsmouth because her captain had no
ready money to pay a distraining baker. The 'Husband'
was in the same plight for twelve days more. The
squadron was, however, increased by seven additional
vessels, one of them commanded by Keymis, through
the enforced waiting at Plymouth, where, on May 3,
Raleigh issued his famous <i>Orders to the Fleet</i>. On June
12 the fleet sailed at last out of Plymouth Sound.</p>

<p>West of Scilly they fell in with a terrific storm,
which scattered the ships in various directions. Some
put back into Falmouth, but the 'Flying Joan' sank
altogether, and the fly-boat was driven up the Bristol
Channel. After nearly a fortnight of anxiety and distress,
the fleet collected again in Cork Harbour, where
they lay repairing and waiting for a favourable wind for
more than six weeks. From the <i>Lismore Papers</i>, just
published (Jan. 1886), we learn that Raleigh occupied
this enforced leisure in getting rid of his remaining
Irish leases, and in collecting as much money as he
could. Sir Richard Boyle records that on July 1 Raleigh
came to his house, and borrowed 100<i>l.</i> On August 19
the last <i>Journal</i> begins, and on the 20th the fleet
left Cork, Raleigh having taken a share in a mine at
Balligara on the morning of the same day. Nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
happened until the 31st, when, being off Cape St. Vincent,
the English fleet fell in with four French vessels laden
with fish and train oil for Seville. In order that they
might not give notice that Raleigh was in those waters,
where he certainly had no business to be, he took these
vessels with him a thousand leagues to the southward,
and then dismissed them with payment. His conduct
towards these French boats was suspicious, and he afterwards
tried to prove that they were pirates who had
harried the Grand Canary. It was also Raleigh's contention,
that the enmity presently shown him by Captain
Bailey, of the 'Husband,' arose from Raleigh's refusal to
let him make one of these French ships his prize.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, September 7, the English fleet
anchored off the shore of Lanzarote, the most easterly of
the Canaries, having hitherto crept down the coast of
Africa. These Atlantic islands were particularly open
to the attacks of Algerine corsairs, and a fleet of 'Turks'
had just ravaged the towns of the Madeiras. The people
of Lanzarote, waking up one morning to find their roadstead
full of strange vessels, took for granted that these
were pirates from Algiers. One English merchant vessel
was lying there at anchor, and by means of this interpreter
Raleigh endeavoured to explain his peaceful
intention, but without success. He had a meeting on
shore with the governor of the island, 'our troops staying
at equal distance with us,' and was asked the pertinent
question, 'what I sought for from that miserable
and barren island, peopled in effect all with Moriscos.'
Raleigh asserted that all he wanted was fresh meat and
wine for his crews, and these he offered to pay for.</p>

<p>On the 11th, finding that no provisions came, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that the inhabitants were carrying their goods up into
the hills, the captains begged Raleigh to march inland
and take the town; 'but,' he says, 'besides that I knew
it would offend his Majesty, I am sure the poor English
merchant should have been ruined, whose goods he had
in his hands, and the way being mountainous and most
extreme stony, I knew that I must have lost twenty
good men in taking a town not worth two groats.' The
Governor of Lanzarote continued to be in a craven state
of anxiety, and would not hear of trading. We cannot
blame him, especially when we find that less than eight
months later his island was invaded by genuine Algerine
bandits, his town utterly sacked, and 900 Christians
taken off into Moslem slavery. After three Englishmen
had been killed by the islanders, yet without taking any
reprisals, Raleigh sailed away from these sandy and inhospitable
shores. But in the night before he left, one
of his ships, the 'Husband,' had disappeared. Captain
Bailey, who is believed to have been in the pay of Gondomar,
had hurried back to England to give report of
Raleigh's piratical attack on an island belonging to the
dominion of Spain. As the great Englishman went sailing
westward through the lustrous waters of the Canary
archipelago, his doom was sealed, and he would have
felt his execution to be a certainty, had he but known
what was happening in England.</p>

<p>He called at Grand Canary, to complain of the
Lanzarote people to the governor-general of the islands,
but, for some reason which he does not state, did not
land at the town of Palmas, but at a desert part, far from
any village, probably west of the northern extremity of
the island. The governor-general gave him no answer;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
but the men found a little water, and they sailed away,
leaving Teneriffe to the north. On September 18 they
put into the excellent port of the island of Gomera,
'the best,' he says, 'in all the Canaries, the town and
castle standing on the very breach of the sea, but the
billows do so tumble and overfall that it is impossible to
land upon any part of the strand but by swimming,
saving in a cove under steep rocks, where they can pass
towards the town but one after the other.' Here, as at
Lanzarote, they were taken for Algerines, and the guns
on the rocks began to fire at them. Raleigh, however,
immediately sent a messenger on shore to explain that
they were not come to sack their town and burn their
churches, as the Dutch had done in 1599, but that they
were in great need of water. They presently came to
an agreement that the islanders should quit their
trenches round the landing-place, and that Raleigh
should promise on the faith of a Christian not to land
more than thirty unarmed sailors, to fill their casks at
springs within pistol-shot of the wash of the sea, none
of these sailors being permitted to enter any house or
garden. Raleigh, therefore, sent six of his seamen,
and turned his ships broadside to the town, ready to
batter it with culverin if he saw one sign of treachery.</p>

<p>It turned out that when the Governor of Gomera
knew who his visitors were, he was as pleased as possible
to see them. His wife's mother had been a Stafford,
and when Raleigh knew that, he sent his countrywoman
a present of six embroidered handkerchiefs and six pairs
of gloves, with a very handsome message. To this the
lady rejoined that she regretted that her barren island
contained nothing worth Raleigh's acceptance, yet sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
him 'four very great loaves of sugar,' with baskets of
lemons, oranges, pomegranates, figs, and most delicate
grapes. During the three days that they rode off
Gomera, the Governor and his English lady wrote daily
to Sir Walter. In return for the fruit, deeming himself
much in her debt, he sent on shore a very courteous
letter, and with it two ounces of ambergriece, an ounce
of the essence of amber, a great glass of fine rose-water,
an excellent picture of Mary Magdalen, and a cut-work
ruff. Here he expected courtesies to stay, but the lady
must positively have the last word, and as the English
ships were starting her servants came on board with
yet a letter, accompanying a basket of delicate white
manchett bread, more clusters of fruits, and twenty-four
fat hens. Meanwhile, in the friendliest way, the
sailors had been going to and fro, and had drawn 240
pipes of water. So cordial, indeed, was their reception,
that, as a last favour, Raleigh asked the Governor for a
letter to Sarmiento [Gondomar], which he got, setting
forth 'how nobly we had behaved ourselves, and how
justly we had dealt with the inhabitants of the islands.'
Before leaving Gomera, Raleigh discharged a native
barque which one of his pinnaces had captured, and
paid at the valuation of the master for any prejudice
that had been done him. On September 21 they sailed
away from the Canaries, having much sickness on board;
and that very day their first important loss occurred, in
the death of the Provost Marshal of the fleet, a man
called Stead.</p>

<p>On the 26th they reached St. Antonio, the outermost
of the Cape Verde Islands, but did not land there.
For eight wretched days they wandered aimlessly about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
in this unfriendly archipelago, trying to make up
their minds to land now on Brava, now on St. Jago.
Some of the ships grated on the rocks, all lost anchors
and cables; one pinnace, her crew being asleep and no
one on the watch, drove under the bowsprit of the
'Destiny,' struck her and sank. When they did effect
a landing on Brava, they were soaked by the tropical
autumnal rains of early October. Men were dying
fast in all the ships. In deep dejection Raleigh gave
the order to steer away for Guiana. Meanwhile Bailey
had arrived in England, had seen Gondomar, and had
openly given out that he left Raleigh because the
admiral had been guilty of piratical acts against Spain.
It does not seem that Winwood or the King took any
notice of these declarations until the end of the year.</p>

<p>The ocean voyage was marked by an extraordinary
number of deaths, among others that of Mr. Fowler,
the principal refiner, whose presence at the gold mine
would have been of the greatest importance. On
October 13, John Talbot, who had been for eleven years
Raleigh's secretary in the Tower, passed away. The
log preserved in the <i>Second Voyage</i> is of great interest,
but we dare not allow its observations to detain us. On
the last of October, Raleigh was struck down by fever
himself, and for twenty days lay unable to eat anything
more solid than a stewed prune. He was in bed, on
November 11, when they sighted Cape Orange, now
the most northerly point belonging to the Empire of
Brazil. On the 14th they anchored at the mouth of
the Cayenne river, and Raleigh was carried from his
noisome cabin into his barge; the 'Destiny' got across
the bar, which was lower then than it now is, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
17th. At Cayenne, after a day or two, Raleigh's old
servant Harry turned up; he had almost forgotten his
English in twenty-two years. Raleigh began to pick
up strength a little on pine-apples and plantains, and
presently he began to venture even upon roast peccary.
He proceeded to spend the next fortnight on the Cayenne
river, refreshing his weary crews, and repairing his
vessels. An interesting letter to his wife that he sent
home from this place, which he called 'Caliana,' confirms
the <i>Second Voyage</i>, and adds some details. He
says to Lady Raleigh: 'To tell you I might be here King
of the Indians were a vanity; but my name hath still
lived among them. Here they feed me with fresh meat
and all that the country yields; all offer to obey me.
Commend me to poor Carew my son.' His eldest son,
Walter, it will be remembered, was with him.</p>

<p>In December the fleet coasted along South America
westward, till on the 15th they stood under Trinidad.
Meanwhile Raleigh had sent forward, by way of Surinam
and Essequibo, the expedition which was to search
for the gold mine on the Orinoco. His own health prevented
his attempting this journey, but he sent Captain
Keymis as commander in his stead, and with him was
George Raleigh, the Admiral's nephew; young Walter
also accompanied the party. On New Year's Eve
Raleigh landed at a village in Trinidad, close to Port of
Spain, and there he waited, on the borders of the land
of pitch, all through January 1618. On the last of that
month he returned to Punto Gallo on the mainland,
being very anxious for news from the Orinoco. The
log of the <i>Second Voyage</i> closes on February 13, and it
is supposed that it was on the evening of that day that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Captain Keymis' disastrous letter, written on January
8, reached Raleigh and informed him of the death of
his son Walter. 'To a broken mind, a sick body, and
weak eyes, it is a torment to write letters,' and we
know he felt, as he also said, that now 'all the respects
of this world had taken end in him.' Keymis had
acted in keeping with what he must have supposed to
be Raleigh's private wish; he had attacked the new
Spanish settlement of San Thom&eacute;. In the fight young
Walter Raleigh had been struck down as he was shouting
'Come on, my men! This is the only mine you
will ever find.' Keymis had to announce this fact to
the father, and a few days afterwards, with only a
remnant of his troop, he himself fled in panic to the sea,
believing that a Spanish army was upon him. The
whole adventure was a miserable and ignominious
failure.</p>

<p>The meeting between Raleigh and Keymis could
not fail to be an embarrassing one. Raleigh could not
but feel that all his own mistakes and faults might
have been condoned if Keymis had brought one basket
of ore from the fabulous mine, and he could not refrain
from reproaching him. He told him he 'should be forced
to leave him to his arguments, with the which if he
could satisfy his Majesty and the State, I should be
glad of it, though for my part he must excuse me to
justify it.' After this first interview Keymis left him
in great dejection, and a day or two later appeared in
the Admiral's cabin with a letter which he had written
to the Earl of Arundel, excusing himself. He begged
Raleigh to forgive him and to read this letter. What
followed, Sir Walter must tell in his own grave words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I told him he had undone me by his obstinacy, and
that I would not favour or colour in any sort his former
folly. He then asked me, whether that were my resolution?
I answered, that it was. He then replied in these words,
'I know then, sir, what course to take,' and went out of my
cabin into his own, in which he was no sooner entered than
I heard a pistol go off. I sent up, not suspecting any such
thing as the killing of himself, to know who shot a pistol.
Keymis himself made answer, lying on his bed, that he had
shot it off, because it had long been charged; with which
I was satisfied. Some half-hour after this, his boy, going
into the cabin, found him dead, having a long knife thrust
under his left pap into his heart, and his pistol lying by
him, with which it appeared he had shot himself; but the
bullet lighting upon a rib, had but broken the rib, and went
no further.</p></div>

<p>Such was the wretched manner in which Raleigh
and his old faithful servant parted. In his despair, the
Admiral's first notion was to plunge himself into the
mazes of the Orinoco, and to find the gold mine, or die
in the search for it. But his men were mutinous; they
openly declared that in their belief no such mine existed,
and that the Spaniards were bearing down on them by
land and sea. They would not go; and Raleigh, strangely
weakened and humbled, asked them if they wished
him to lead them against the Mexican plate fleet. He
told them that he had a commission from France, and
that they would be pardoned in England if they came
home laden with treasure.</p>

<p>What exactly happened no one knows. The mutiny
grew worse and worse, and on March 21, when Raleigh
wrote a long letter to prepare the mind of Winwood, he
was lying off St. Christopher's on his homeward voyage;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
not knowing of course that his best English friend had
already been dead five months. Next day, he made up
his mind that he dared not return to England to face his
enemies, and he wrote to tell his wife that he was off to
Newfoundland, 'where I mean to make clean my ships,
and revictual; for I have tobacco enough to pay for it.'
But he was powerless, as he confesses, to govern his
crew, and no one knows how the heartbroken old man
spent the next two dreadful months. His ships slunk
back piecemeal to English havens, and on May 23,
Captain North, who had commanded the 'Chudleigh,'
had audience of the King, and told him the whole
miserable story. On May 26,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Raleigh made his appearance,
with the 'Destiny,' in the harbour of Kinsale,
and on June 21 he arrived in Plymouth, penniless and
dejected, for the first time in his life utterly unnerved
and irresolute. On June 16 he had written an apologetic
letter to the King. By some curious slip Mr.
Edwards dated this letter three months too late, and
its significance has therefore been overlooked. It is
important as showing that Raleigh was eager to conciliate
James.</p>

<h3>THE END.</h3>


<p>Gondomar had not been idle during Raleigh's absence,
but so long as Winwood was alive he had not been able
to attack the absent Admiral with much success. As
soon as Bailey brought him the news of the supposed
attack on Lanzarote, he communicated with his Government,
and urged that an embargo should be laid on the
goods of the English merchant colony at Seville. This
angry despatch, the result of a vain attempt to reach
James, is dated October 22; and on October 27 the
sudden death of Winwood removed Gondomar's principal
obstacle to the ruin of Raleigh. At first, however, Bailey's
story received no credence, and if, as Howel somewhat
apocryphally relates, Gondomar had been forbidden to say
two words about Raleigh in the King's presence, and
therefore entered with uplifted hands shouting 'Pirates!'
till James was weary, he did not seem to gain much
ground. Moreover, while Bailey's story was being discussed,
the little English merchant vessel which had been
lying in Lanzarote during Raleigh's visit returned to
London, and gave evidence which brought Bailey to
gaol in the Gate House.</p>

<p>On January 11, 1618, before any news had been
received from Guiana, a large gathering was held in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the Council Chamber at Westminster, to try Bailey
for false accusation. The Council contained many men
favourable to Raleigh, but the Spanish ambassador
brought influence to bear on the King; and late in
February, Bailey was released with a reprimand, although
he had accused Raleigh not of piracy only, but of high
treason. The news of the ill-starred attack on San
Thom&eacute; reached Madrid on May 3, and London on the
8th. This must have given exquisite pleasure to the
baffled Gondomar, and he lost no time in pressing
James for revenge. He gave the King the alternative
of punishing Raleigh in England or sending him as a
prisoner to Spain. The King wavered for a month.
Meanwhile vessel after vessel brought more conclusive
news of the piratical expedition in which Keymis had
failed, and Gondomar became daily more importunate.
It began to be thought that Raleigh had taken flight
for Paris.</p>

<p>At, last, on June 11, James I. issued a proclamation
inviting all who had a claim against Raleigh to
present it to the Council. Lord Nottingham at the
same time outlawed the 'Destiny' in whatever English
port she might appear. It does not seem that the
King was unduly hasty in condemning Raleigh. He
had given Spain every solemn pledge that Raleigh
should not injure Spain, and yet the Admiral's only act
had been to fall on an unsuspecting Spanish settlement;
notwithstanding this, James argued as long as he could
that San Thom&eacute; lay outside the agreement. The arrival
of the 'Destiny,' however, seems to have clinched Gondomar's
arguments. Three days after Raleigh arrived
in Plymouth, the King assured Spain that 'not all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
those who have given security for Raleigh can save him
from the gallows.' For the particulars of the curious
intrigues of these summer months the reader must be referred,
once more, to Mr. Gardiner's dispassionate pages.</p>

<p>On June 21, Raleigh moored the 'Destiny' in
Plymouth harbour, and sent her sails ashore. Lady
Raleigh hastened down to meet him, and they stayed
in Plymouth a fortnight. His wife and he, with Samuel
King, one of his captains, then set out for London, but
were met just outside Ashburton by Sir Lewis Stukely,
a cousin of Raleigh's, now Vice-Admiral of Devonshire.
This man announced that he had the King's orders to
arrest Sir Walter Raleigh; but these were only verbal
orders, and he took his prisoner back to Plymouth to
await the Council warrant. Raleigh was lodged for
nine or ten days in the house of Sir Christopher Harris,
Stukely being mainly occupied in securing the 'Destiny'
and her contents. Raleigh pretended to be ill, or was
really indisposed with anxiety and weariness. While
Stukely was thinking of other things, Raleigh commissioned
Captain King to hire a barque to slip over to
La Rochelle, and one night Raleigh and King made
their escape towards this vessel in a little boat. But
Raleigh probably reflected that without money or influence
he would be no safer in France than in England,
and before the boat reached the vessel, he turned back
and went home. He ordered the barque to be in readiness
the next night, but although no one watched him,
he made no second effort to escape.</p>

<p>On July 23 the Privy Council ordered Stukely,
'all delays set apart,' to bring the body of Sir Walter
Raleigh speedily to London. Two days later, Stukely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and his prisoner started from Plymouth. A French
quack, called Mannourie, in whose chemical pretensions
Raleigh had shown some interest, was encouraged by
Stukely to attend him, and to worm himself into his
confidence. As Walter and Elizabeth Raleigh passed
the beautiful Sherborne which had once been theirs, the
former could not refrain from saying, 'All this was mine,
and it was taken from me unjustly.' They travelled
quickly, sleeping at Sherborne on the 26th, and next
night at Salisbury. Raleigh lost all confidence as he
found himself so hastily being taken up to London. As
they went from Wilton into Salisbury, Raleigh asked
Mannourie to give him a vomit; 'by its means I shall
gain time to work my friends, and order my affairs;
perhaps even to pacify his Majesty. Otherwise, as soon
as ever I come to London, they will have me to the
Tower, and cut off my head.'</p>

<p>That same evening, while being conducted to his
rooms, Raleigh struck his head against a post. It was
supposed to show that he was dizzy; and next morning
he sent Lady Raleigh and her retinue on to London,
saying that he himself was not well enough to move.
At the same time, King went on to prepare a ship to be
ready in the Thames in case of another emergency.
When they had started, Raleigh was discovered in his
bedroom, on all fours, in his shirt, gnawing the rushes
on the floor. Stukely was completely taken in; the
French quack had given Raleigh, not an emetic only,
but some ointment which caused his skin to break
out in dark purple pustules. Stukely rushed off to
the Bishop of Ely, who happened to be in Salisbury,
and acted on his advice to wait for Raleigh's recovery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Unless Stukely also was mountebanking, the spy Mannourie
for the present kept Raleigh's counsel. Raleigh
was treated as an invalid, and during the four days' retirement
contrived to write his <i>Apology for the Voyage
to Guiana</i>. On August 1, James I. and all his Court
entered Salisbury, and on the morning of the same day
Stukely hurried his prisoner away lest he should meet
the King. Some pity, however, was shown to Raleigh's
supposed dying state, and permission was granted him
to go straight to his own London house. His hopes revived,
and he very rashly bribed both Mannourie and
Stukely to let him escape. So confident was he, that
he refused the offers of a French envoy, who met him at
Brentford with proposals of a secret passage over to
France, and a welcome in Paris. He was broken altogether;
he had no dignity, no judgment left.</p>

<p>Raleigh arrived at his house in Broad Street on
August 7. On the 9th the French repeated their invitation.
Again it was refused, for King had seen Raleigh
and had told him that a vessel was lying at Tilbury ready
to carry him over to France. Her captain, Hart, was an
old boatswain of King's; before Raleigh received the
information, this man had already reported the whole
scheme to the Government. The poor adventurer was
surrounded by spies, from Stukely downwards, and the
toils were gathering round him on every side. On the
evening of the same August 9, Raleigh, accompanied by
Captain King, Stukely, Hart, and a page, embarked from
the river-side in two wherries, and was rowed down towards
Tilbury. Raleigh presently noticed that a larger
boat was following them; at Greenwich, Stukely threw
off the mask of friendship and arrested King, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
thrown then and there into the Tower. What became of
Raleigh that night does not appear; he was put into the
Tower next day. When he was arrested his pockets were
found full of jewels and golden ornaments, the diamond
ring Queen Elizabeth had given him, a loadstone in a
scarlet purse, an ounce of ambergriece, and fifty pounds
in gold; these fell into the hands of the traitor 'Sir
Judas' Stukely.</p>

<p>Outside the Tower the process of Raleigh's legal condemnation
now pursued its course. A commission was
appointed to consider the charges brought against
the prisoner, and evidence was collected on all sides.
Raleigh was obliged to sit with folded hands. He could
only hope that the eloquence and patriotism of his <i>Apology</i>
might possibly appeal to the sympathy of James.
As so often before, he merely showed that he was ignorant
of the King's character, for James read the <i>Apology</i>
without any other feeling than one of triumph that it
amounted to a confession of guilt. The only friend
that Raleigh could now appeal to was Anne of Denmark,
and to her he forwarded, about August 15, a long petition
in verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cold walls, to you I speak, but you are senseless!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Celestial Powers, you hear, but have determined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shall determine, to my greatest happiness.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then unto whom shall I unfold my wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast down my tears, or hold up folded hands?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Her to whom remorse doth most belong;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To Her, who is the first, and may alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be justly called, the Empress of the Britons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who should have mercy if a Queen have none?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Queen Anne responded as she had always done to
Raleigh's appeals. If his life had lain in her hands,
it would have been a long and a happy one. She
immediately wrote to Buckingham, knowing that his
influence was far greater than her own with the King,
and her letter exists for the wonder of posterity. She
writes to her husband's favourite: 'My kind Dog,' for
so the poor lady stoops to address him, 'if I have any
power or credit with you, I pray you let me have a
trial of it, at this time, in dealing sincerely and earnestly
with the King that Sir Walter Raleigh's life may not
be called in question.' Buckingham, however, was
already pledged to aid the Spanish alliance, and the
Queen's letter was unavailing.</p>

<p>On August 17 and on two subsequent occasions
Raleigh was examined before the Commissioners, the
charge being formally drawn up by Yelverton, the
Attorney-General. He was accused of having abused
the King's confidence by setting out to find gold in a
mine which never existed, with instituting a piratical
attack on a peaceful Spanish settlement, with attempting
to capture the Mexican plate fleet, although he had
been specially warned that he would take his life in
his hands if he committed any one of these three faults.
It is hard to understand how Mr. Edwards persuaded
himself to brand each of these charges as 'a distinct
falsehood.' The sympathy we must feel for Raleigh's
misfortunes, and the enthusiasm with which we read
the <i>Apology</i>, should not, surely, blind us to the fact that
in neither of these three matters was his action true or
honest. We have no particular account of his examinations,
but it is almost certain that they wrung from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
him admissions of a most damaging character. He
had tried to make James a catspaw in revenging himself
on Spain, and he had to take the consequences.</p>

<p>It was of great importance to the Government to
understand why France had meddled in the matter.
The Council, therefore, summoned La Chesn&eacute;e, the
envoy who had made propositions to Raleigh at Brentford
and at Broad Street; but he denied the whole
story, and said he never suggested flight to Raleigh.
So little information had been gained by the middle
of September, that it was determined to employ a
professional spy. The person selected for this engaging
office was Sir Thomas Wilson, one of the band of
English pensioners in the pay of Spain. The most
favourable thing that has ever been said of Stukely is
that he was not quite such a scoundrel as Wilson. On
September 9 this person, who had known Raleigh from
Elizabeth's days, and was now Keeper of the State
Papers, was supplied with 'convenient lodging within or
near unto the chambers of Sir Walter Raleigh.' At the
same time Sir Allen Apsley, the Lieutenant, who had
guarded the prisoner hitherto, was relieved.</p>

<p>Wilson's first act was not one of conciliation. He
demanded that Raleigh should be turned out of his comfortable
quarters in the Wardrobe Tower to make room
for Wilson, who desired that the prisoner should have
the smaller rooms above. To this, and other demands,
Apsley would not accede. Wilson then began to do
his best to insinuate himself into Raleigh's confidence,
and after about a fortnight seems to have succeeded.
We have a very full report of his conversations with
Raleigh, but they add little to our knowledge, even if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Wilson's evidence could be taken as gospel. Raleigh
admitted La Chesn&eacute;e's offer of a French passage, and
his own proposal to seize the Mexican fleet; but both
these points were already known to the Council.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September two events occurred
which brought matters more to a crisis. On the 24th
Raleigh wrote a confession to the King, in which he
said that the French Government had given him a commission,
that La Chesn&eacute;e had three times offered him
escape, and that he himself was in possession of
important State secrets, of which he would make a clean
breast if the King would pardon him. This important
document was found at Simancas, and first published
in 1868 by Mr. St. John. On the same day Philip III.
sent a despatch to James I. desiring him in peremptory
terms to save him the trouble of hanging Raleigh at
Madrid by executing him promptly in London. As
soon as this ultimatum arrived, James applied to the
Commissioners to know how it would be best to deal
with the prisoner judicially. Several lawyers assured
him that Raleigh was under sentence of death, and that
therefore no trial was necessary; but James shrank
from the scandal of apparent murder. The Commissioners
were so fully satisfied of Raleigh's guilt that
they advised the King to give him a public trial, under
somewhat unusual forms. He was to be tried before
the Council and the judges, a few persons of rank being
admitted as spectators; the conduct of the trial to be
the same as though it were proceeding in Westminster
Hall. On receipt of the despatch from Madrid, that is
to say on October 3, Lady Raleigh, whose presence was
no longer required, was released from the Tower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>The trial before the Commissioners began on October
22. Mr. Gardiner has printed in the <i>Camden Miscellany</i>
such notes of cross-examination as were preserved by
Sir Julius C&aelig;sar, but they are very slight. Raleigh
seems to have denied any intention to stir up war
between England and Spain, and declared that he had
confidently believed in the existence of the mine. But
he made no attempt to deny that in case the mine failed
he had proposed the taking of the Mexican fleet. At
the close of the examination, Bacon,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> in the name of the
Commissioners, told Raleigh that he was guilty of
abusing the confidence of King James and of injuring
the subjects of Spain, and that he must prepare to die,
being 'already civilly dead.' Raleigh was then taken
back to the Tower, where he was left in suspense for
ten days. Meanwhile the Justices of the King's Bench
were desired to award execution upon the old Winchester
sentence of 1603. It is thought that James
hoped to keep Raleigh from appearing again in public,
but the judges said that he must be brought face to
face with them. On October 28, therefore, Raleigh was
roused from his bed, where he was suffering from a severe
attack of the ague, and was brought out of the Tower,
which he never entered again. He was taken so hastily
that he had no time for his toilet, and his barber called
out that his master had not combed his head. 'Let
them kem that are to have it,' was Raleigh's answer;
and he continued, 'Dost thou know, Peter, any plaister
that will set a man's head on again, when it is off?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>When he came before Yelverton, he attempted to
argue that the Guiana commission had wiped out all
the past, including the sentence of 1603. He began to
discuss anew his late voyage; but the Chief Justice, interrupting
him, told him that he was to be executed for
the old treason, not for this new one. Raleigh then threw
himself on the King's mercy, being every way trapped
and fettered; without referring to this appeal, the Chief
Justice proceeded to award execution. Raleigh was to
be beheaded early next morning in Old Palace Yard.
He entreated for a few days' respite, that he might finish
some writings, but the King had purposely left town
that no petitions for delay might reach him. Bacon
produced the warrant, which he had drawn up, and
which bore the King's signature and the Great Seal.</p>

<p>Raleigh was taken from Westminster Hall to the
Gate House. He was in high spirits, and meeting his old
friend Sir Hugh Beeston, he urged him to secure a
good place at the show next morning. He himself, he
said, was sure of one. He was so gay and chatty, that
his cousin Francis Thynne begged him to be more grave
lest his enemies should report his levity. Raleigh
answered, 'It is my last mirth in this world; do not
grudge it to me.' Dr. Tounson, Dean of Westminster,
to whom Raleigh was a stranger, then attended him;
and was somewhat scandalised at this flow of mercurial
spirits. 'When I began,' says the Dean, 'to encourage
him against the fear of death, he seemed to make so
light of it that I wondered at him. When I told him
that the dear servants of God, in better causes than his,
had shrunk back and trembled a little, he denied it not.
But yet he gave God thanks that he had never feared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
death.' The good Dean was puzzled; but his final reflection
was all to Raleigh's honour. After the execution
he reported that 'he was the most fearless of death
that ever was known, and the most resolute and confident;
yet with reverence and conscience.'</p>

<p>It was late on Thursday evening, the 28th, that
Lady Raleigh learned the position of affairs. She had
not dreamed that the case was so hopeless. She
hastened to the Gate House, and until midnight husband
and wife were closeted together in conversation, she being
consoled and strengthened by his calm. Her last word
was that she had obtained permission to dispose of his
body. 'It is well, Bess,' he said, 'that thou mayst
dispose of that dead, which thou hadst not always the
disposing of when alive.' And so, with a smile, they
parted. When his wife had left him, Raleigh sat down
to write his last verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even such is time, that takes in trust<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Our youth, our joys, our all we have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pays us but with earth and dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who in the dark and silent grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we have wandered all our ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuts up the story of our days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from this earth, this grave, this dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My God shall raise me up, I trust.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the same hour Lady Raleigh was preparing for the
horrors of the morrow. She sent off this note to her
brother, Sir Nicholas Carew:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I desire, good brother, that you will be pleased to let
me bury the worthy body of my noble husband, Sir Walter
Raleigh, in your church at Beddington, where I desire to
be buried. The Lords have given me his dead body, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
they denied me his life. This night he shall be brought
you with two or three of my men. Let me hear presently.
God hold me in my wits.</p></div>

<p>There was probably some difficulty in the way, for
Raleigh's body was not brought that night to Beddington.</p>

<p>In the morning the Dean of Westminster entered
the Gate House again. Raleigh, who had perhaps not
gone to bed all night, had just finished a testamentary
paper of defence. Dr. Tounson found him still very
cheerful and merry, and administered the Communion
to him. After the Eucharist, Raleigh talked very freely
to the Dean, defending himself, and going back in his
reminiscences to the reign of Elizabeth. He declared
that the world would yet be persuaded of his innocence,
and he once more scandalised the Dean by his truculent
cheerfulness. He ate a hearty breakfast, and smoked
a pipe of tobacco. It was now time to leave the Gate
House; but before he did so, a cup of sack was brought
to him. The servant asked if the wine was to his liking,
and Raleigh replied, 'I will answer you as did the
fellow who drank of St. Giles' bowl as he went to
Tyburn, "It is good drink, if a man might stay by it."'</p>

<p>This excitement lasted without reaction until he
reached the scaffold, whither he was led by the sheriffs,
still attended by Dr. Tounson. As they passed through
the vast throng of persons who had come to see the
spectacle, Raleigh observed a very old man bareheaded
in the crowd, and snatching off the rich night-cap of cut
lace which he himself was wearing, he threw it to him,
saying, 'Friend, you need this more than I do.' Raleigh
was dressed in a black embroidered velvet night-gown
over a hare-coloured satin doublet and a black embroi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>dered
waistcoat. He wore a ruff-band, a pair of black
cut taffetas breeches, and ash-coloured silk stockings,
thus combining his taste for magnificence with a decent
regard for the occasion. The multitude so pressed upon
him, and he had walked with such an animated step,
that when he ascended the scaffold, erect and smiling,
he was observed to be quite out of breath.</p>

<p>There are many contemporary reports of Sir Walter
Raleigh's deportment at this final moment of his life.
In the place of these hackneyed narratives, we may
perhaps quote the less-known words of another bystander,
the republican Sir John Elyot, who was at that
time a young man of twenty-eight. In his <i>Monarchy
of Man</i>, which remained in manuscript until 1879,
Elyot says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Take an example in that else unmatched fortitude of
our Raleigh, the magnanimity of his sufferings, that large
chronicle of fortitude. All the preparations that are
terrible presented to his eye, guards and officers about him,
fetters and chains upon him, the scaffold and executioner
before him, and then the axe, and more cruel expectation
of his enemies, and what did all that work on the resolution
of that worthy? Made it an impression of weak fear, or a
distraction of his reason? Nothing so little did that great
soul suffer, but gathered more strength and advantage upon
either. His mind became the clearer, as if already it had
been freed from the cloud and oppression of the body, and
that trial gave an illustration to his courage, so that it
changed the affection of his enemies, and turned their joy
into sorrow, and all men else it filled with admiration,
leaving no doubt but this, whether death was more acceptable
to him, or he more welcome unto death.</p></div>

<p>At the windows of Sir Randolph Carew, which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
opposite to the scaffold, Raleigh observed a cluster of
gentlemen and noblemen, and in particular several of
those who had been adventurers with him for the mine
on the Orinoco. He perceived, amongst others, the Earls
of Arundel, Oxford, and Northampton. That these old
friends should hear distinctly what he had to say was
his main object, and he therefore addressed them with
an apology for the weakness of his voice, and asked
them to come down to him. Arundel at once assented,
and all the company at Carew's left the balcony, and
came on to the scaffold, where those who had been intimate
with Raleigh solemnly embraced him. He then
began his celebrated speech, of which he had left a brief
draft signed in the Gate House. There are extant
several versions of this address, besides the one he
signed. In the excitement of the scene, he seems to
have said more, and to have put it more ingeniously,
than in the solitude of the previous night. His old
love of publicity, of the open air, appeared in the first
sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I thank God that He has sent me to die in the light, and
not in darkness. I likewise thank God that He has suffered
me to die before such an assembly of honourable witnesses,
and not obscurely in the Tower, where for the space of
thirteen years together I have been oppressed with many
miseries. And I return Him thanks, that my fever [the
ague] hath not taken me at this time, as I prayed to Him
that it might not, that I might clear myself of such accusations
unjustly laid to my charge, and leave behind me the
testimony of a true heart both to my king and country.</p></div>

<p>He was justly elated. He knew that his resources
were exhausted, his energies abated, and that pardon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
would now merely mean a relegation to oblivion. He
took his public execution with delight, as if it were a
martyrdom, and had the greatness of soul to perceive
that nothing could possibly commend his career and
character to posterity so much as to leave this mortal
stage with a telling soliloquy. His powers were
drawn together to their height; his intellect, which
had lately seemed to be growing dim, had never flashed
more brilliantly, and the biographer can recall but one
occasion in Raleigh's life, and that the morning of St.
Barnaby at Cadiz, when his bearing was of quite so
gallant a magnificence. As he stood on the scaffold in
the cold morning air, he foiled James and Philip at one
thrust, and conquered the esteem of all posterity. It is
only now, after two centuries and a half, that history is
beginning to hint that there was not a little special
pleading and some excusable equivocation in this great
apology which rang through monarchical England like
the blast of a clarion, and which echoed in secret places
till the oppressed rose up and claimed their liberty.</p>

<p>He spoke for about five-and-twenty minutes. His
speech was excessively ingenious, as well as eloquent,
and directed to move the sympathy of his hearers as
much as possible, without any deviation from literal
truth. He said that it was true that he had tried to
escape to France, but that his motive was not treasonable;
he knew the King to be justly incensed, and
thought that from La Rochelle he might negotiate his
pardon. What he said about the commission from
France is so ingeniously worded, as to leave us absolutely
without evidence from this quarter. After speaking
about La Chesn&eacute;e's visits, he proceeded to denounce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the base Mannourie and his miserable master Sir Lewis
Stukely, yet without a word of unseemly invective. He
then defended his actions in the Guiana voyage, and
turning brusquely to the Earl of Arundel, appealed to
him for evidence that the last words spoken between
them as the 'Destiny' left the Thames were of Raleigh's
return to England. This was to rebut the accusation
that Raleigh had been overpowered by his mutinous
crew, and brought to Kinsale against his will. Arundel
answered, 'And so you did!' The Sheriff presently
showing some impatience, Raleigh asked pardon, and
begged to say but a few words more. He had been
vexed to find that the Dean of Westminster believed a
story which was in general circulation to the effect
that Raleigh behaved insolently at the execution of
Essex, 'puffing out tobacco in disdain of him;' this he
solemnly denied. He then closed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And now I entreat that you will all join me in prayer to
the Great God of Heaven, whom I have grievously offended,
being a man full of all vanity, who has lived a sinful life in
such callings as have been most inducing to it; for I have
been a soldier, a sailor, and a courtier, which are courses
of wickedness and vice; that His almighty goodness will
forgive me; that He will cast away my sins from me; and
that He will receive me into everlasting life.&mdash;So I take
my leave of you all, making my peace with God.</p></div>

<p>Proclamation was then made that all visitors should
quit the scaffold. In parting with his friends, Raleigh
besought them, and Arundel in particular, to beg the King
to guard his memory against scurrilous pamphleteers.
The noblemen lingered so long, that it was Raleigh
himself who gently dismissed them. 'I have a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
journey to go,' he said, and smiled, 'therefore I must
take my leave of you.' When the friends had retired he
addressed himself to prayer, having first announced that
he died in the faith of the Church of England. When
his prayer was done, he took off his night-gown and
doublet, and called to the headsman to show him the
axe. The man hesitated, and Raleigh cried, 'I prithee,
let me see it. Dost thou think that I am afraid of it?'
Having passed his finger along the edge, he gave it
back, and turning to the Sheriff, smiled, and said, ''Tis
a sharp medicine, but one that will cure me of all my
diseases.' The executioner, overcome with emotion,
kneeled before him for pardon. Raleigh put his two
hands upon his shoulders, and said he forgave him with
all his heart. He added, 'When I stretch forth my
hands, despatch me.' He then rose erect, and bowed
ceremoniously to the spectators to the right and then to
the left, and said aloud, 'Give me heartily your prayers.'
The Sheriff then asked him which way he would lay
himself on the block. Raleigh answered, 'So the heart
be right, it matters not which way the head lies,' but he
chose to lie facing the east. The headsman hastened
to place his own cloak beneath him, so displaying the
axe. Raleigh then lay down, and the company was
hushed while he remained awhile in silent prayer. He
was then seen to stretch out his hands, but the headsman
was absolutely unnerved and could not stir. Raleigh
repeated the action, but again without result. The
rich Devonshire voice was then heard again, and for
the last time. 'What dost thou fear? Strike, man,
strike!' His body neither twitched nor trembled;
only his lips were seen still moving in prayer. At last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the headsman summoned his resolution, and though he
struck twice, the first blow was fatal.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was probably well advanced in
his sixty-seventh year, but grief and travel had made
him look much older. He was still vigorous, however,
and the effusion from his body was so extraordinary,
that many of the spectators shared the wonder of Lady
Macbeth, that the old man had so much blood in him.
The head was shown to the spectators, on both sides of
the scaffold, and was then dropped into a red bag. The
body was wrapt in the velvet night-gown, and both
were carried to Lady Raleigh. By this time, perhaps,
she had heard from her brother that he could not
receive the body at Beddington, for she presently had
it interred in the chancel of St. Margaret's, Westminster.
The head she caused to be embalmed, and
kept it with her all her life, permitting favoured friends,
like Bishop Goodman, to see and even to kiss it. After
her death, Carew Raleigh preserved it with a like piety.
It is supposed now to rest in West Horsley church
in Surrey. Lady Raleigh lived on until 1647, thus
witnessing the ruin of the dynasty which had destroyed
her own happiness.</p>

<p>No success befell the wretches who had enriched
themselves by Raleigh's ruin. Sir Judas Stukely, for
so he was now commonly styled, was shunned by all
classes of society. It was discovered very soon after the
execution, that Stukely had for years past been a clipper
of coin of the realm. He did not get his blood-money
until Christmas 1618, and in January 1619 he was caught
with his guilty fingers at work on some of the very
gold pieces for which he had sold his master. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
meaner rascal, Mannourie, fell with him. The populace
clamoured for Stukely's death on the gallows, but the
King allowed him to escape. Wherever he met human
beings, however, they taunted him with the memory of
Sir Walter Raleigh, and at last he fled to the desolate
island of Lundy, where his brain gave way under the
weight of remorse and solitude. He died there, a
maniac, in 1620. Another of Raleigh's enemies, though
a less malignant one, scarcely survived him. Lord
Cobham, who had been released from the Tower while
Raleigh was in the Canaries, died of lingering paralysis
on January 24, 1619. Of other persons who were
closely associated with Raleigh, Queen Anne died in
the same year, 1619; Camden in 1623; James I. in
1625; Nottingham, at the age of eighty-nine, in 1624;
Bacon in 1629; Ben Jonson in 1637; while the Earl
of Arundel lived on until 1646.</p>

then have been over eighty years of age.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Mr. J. Cordy Jeaffreson has communicated to me the following
interesting discovery, which he has made in examining the
Assembly Books of the borough of King's Lynn, in Norfolk. It
appears that the Mayor was paid ten pounds 'in respecte he did
in the yere of his maioraltie [between Michaelmas 1587 and
Michaelmas 1588] entertayn Sir Walter Rawlye knight and his
companye in resortinge hether about the Queanes affayrs;' the
occasion being, it would seem, the furnishing and setting forth of a
ship of war and a pinnace as the contingent from Lynn towards
defence against the Armada. This is an important fact, for it is
the only definite record that has hitherto reached us of Raleigh's
activity in guarding the coast against invasion.</p></div>
